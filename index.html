        PART ONE
        CHIBA CITY BLUES


        1

  The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned
to a dead channel.
  `It's not like I'm using,' Case heard someone say, as he
shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the
Chat.  `It's like my body's developed this massive drug defi-
ciency.'  It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke.  The Chatsubo
was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there
for a week and never hear two words in Japanese.
  Ratz was tending bar, his prosthetic arm jerking monoto-
nously as he filled a tray of glasses with draft Kirin.  He saw
Case and smiled, his teeth a webwork of East European steel
and brown decay.  Case found a place at the bar, between the
unlikely tan on one of Lonny Zone's whores and the crisp naval
uniform of a tall African whose cheekbones were ridged with
precise rows of tribal scars.  `Wage was in here early, with two
joeboys,' Ratz said, shoving a draft across the bar with his
good hand.  `Maybe some business with you, Case?'
  Case shrugged.  The girl to his right giggled and nudged
him.
  The bartender's smile widened.  His ugliness was the stuff
of legend.  In an age of affordable beauty, there was something
heraldic about his lack of it.  The antique arm whined as he
reached for another mug.  It was a Russian military prosthesis,
a seven-function force-feedback manipulator, cased in grubby
pink plastic.  `You are too much the artiste, Herr Case.'  Ratz
grunted; the sound served him as laughter.  He scratched his
overhang of white-shirted belly with the pink claw.  `You are
the artiste of the slightly funny deal.'
  `Sure,' Case said, and sipped his beer.  `Somebody's gotta
be funny around here.  Sure the fuck isn't you.'
  The whore's giggle went up an octave.
  `Isn't you either, sister.  So you vanish, okay?  Zone, he's
a close personal friend of mine.'
  She looked Case in the eye and made the softest possible
spitting sound, her lips barely moving.  But she left.
  `Jesus,' Case said, `what kinda creepjoint you running here? 
Man can't have a drink.'
  `Ha,' Ratz said, swabbing the scarred wood with a rag,
`Zone shows a percentage.  You I let work here for entertain-
ment value.'
  As Case was picking up his beer, one of those strange
instants of silence descended, as though a hundred unrelated
conversations had simultaneously arrived at the same pause. 
Then the whore's giggle rang out, tinged with a certain hysteria.
  Ratz grunted.  `An angel passed.'
  `The Chinese,' bellowed a drunken Australian, `Chinese
bloody invented nerve-splicing.  Give me the mainland for a
nerve job any day.  Fix you right, mate...'
  `Now that,' Case said to his glass, all his bitterness suddenly
rising in him like bile, `that is _so_ much bullshit.'

  The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than
the Chinese had ever known.  The black clinics of Chiba were
the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly,
and still they couldn't repair the damage he'd suffered in that
Memphis hotel.
  A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading
nightly.  All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the
corners he'd cut in Night City, and still he'd see the matrix in
his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless
void...  The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the
Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cow-
boy.  Just another hustler, trying to make it through.  But the
dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo,
and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the
dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands
clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fin-
gers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.

  `I saw your girl last night,' Ratz said, passing Case his
second Kirin.
  `I don't have one,' he said, and drank.
  `Miss Linda Lee.'
  Case shook his head.
  `No girl?  Nothing?  Only biz, friend artiste?  Dedication to
commerce?'  The bartender's small brown eyes were nested
deep in wrinkled flesh.  `I think I liked you better, with her. 
You laughed more.  Now, some night, you get maybe too ar-
tistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.'
  `You're breaking my heart, Ratz.'  He finished his beer,
paid and left, high narrow shoulders hunched beneath the rain-
stained khaki nylon of his windbreaker.  Threading his way
through the Ninsei crowds, he could smell his own stale sweat.

  Case was twenty-four.  At twenty-two, he'd been a cowboy,
a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl.  He'd been trained by
the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the
biz.  He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a
byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cy-
berspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness
into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix.  A thief,
he'd worked for other, wealthier thieves, employers who pro-
vided the exotic software required to penetrate the bright walls
of corporate systems, opening windows into rich fields of data.
  He'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd
never make.  He stole from his employers.  He kept something
for himself and tried to move it through a fence in Amsterdam. 
He still wasn't sure how he'd been discovered, not that it
mattered now.  He'd expected to die, then, but they only smiled. 
Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome to the
money.  And he was going to need it.  Because -- still smiling --
they were going to make sure he never worked again.
  They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian
mycotoxin.
  Strapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning
out micron by micron, he hallucinated for thirty hours.
  The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective.
  For Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyber-
space, it was the Fall.  In the bars he'd frequented as a cowboy
hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt
for the flesh.  The body was meat.  Case fell into the prison of
his own flesh.

  His total assets were quickly converted to New Yen, a fat
sheaf of the old paper currency that circulated endlessly through
the closed circuit of the world's black markets like the seashells
of the Trobriand islanders.  It was difficult to transact legitimate
business with cash in the Sprawl; in Japan, it was already
illegal.
  In Japan, he'd known with a clenched and absolute certainty,
he'd find his cure.  In Chiba.  Either in a registered clinic or in
the shadowland of black medicine.  Synonymous with implants,
nerve-splicing, and microbionics, Chiba was a magnet for the
Sprawl's techno-criminal subcultures.
  In Chiba, he'd watched his New Yen vanish in a two-month
round of examinations and consultations.  The men in the black
clinics, his last hope, had admired the expertise with which
he'd been maimed, and then slowly shaken their heads.
  Now he slept in the cheapest coffins, the ones nearest the
port, beneath the quartz-halogen floods that lit the docks all
night like vast stages; where you couldn't see the lights of
Tokyo for the glare of the television sky, not even the towering
hologram logo of the Fuji Electric Company, and Tokyo Bay
was a black expanse where gulls wheeled above drifting shoals
of white styrofoam.  Behind the port lay the city, factory domes
dominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies.  Port and
city were divided by a narrow borderland of older streets, an
area with no official name.  Night City, with Ninsei its heart. 
By day, the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless,
the neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting, under the poisoned
silver sky.

  Two blocks west of the Chat, in a teashop called the Jarre
de Th, Case washed down the night's first pill with a double
espresso.  It was a flat pink octagon, a potent species of Bra-
zilian dex he bought from one of Zone's girls.
  The Jarre was walled with mirrors, each panel framed in
red neon.
  At first, finding himself alone in Chiba, with little money
and less hope of finding a cure, he'd gone into a kind of terminal
overdrive, hustling fresh capital with a cold intensity that had
seemed to belong to someone else.  In the first month, he'd
killed two men and a woman over sums that a year before
would have seemed ludicrous.  Ninsei wore him down until the
street itself came to seem the externalization of some death
wish, some secret poison he hadn't known he carried.
  Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Dar-
winism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb
permanently on the fast-forward button.  Stop hustling and you
sank without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you'd
break the fragile surface tension of the black market; either
way, you were gone, with nothing left of you but some vague
memory in the mind of a fixture like Ratz, though heart or
lungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger
with New Yen for the clinic tanks.
  Biz here was a constant subliminal hum, and death the
accepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace,
the failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.
  Alone at a table in the Jarre de Th, with the octagon coming
on, pinheads of sweat starting from his palms, suddenly aware
of each tingling hair on his arms and chest, Case knew that at
some point he'd started to play a game with himself, a very
ancient one that has no name, a final solitaire.  He no longer
carried a weapon, no longer took the basic precautions.  He ran
the fastest, loosest deals on the street, and he had a reputation
for being able to get whatever you wanted.  A part of him knew
that the arc of his self-destruction was glaringly obvious to his
customers, who grew steadily fewer, but that same part of him
basked in the knowledge that it was only a matter of time.  And
that was the part of him, smug in its expectation of death, that
most hated the thought of Linda Lee.
  He'd found her, one rainy night, in an arcade.
  Under bright ghosts burning through a blue haze of cigar-
ette smoke, holograms of Wizard's Castle, Tank War Europa,
the New York skyline...  And now he remembered her that
way, her face bathed in restless laser light, features reduced to
a code: her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard's Castle burned,
forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank
War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck
sparks from the wall of a skyscraper canyon.  He was riding
high that night, with a brick of Wage's ketamine on its way
to Yokohama and the money already in his pocket.  He'd come
in out of the warm rain that sizzled across the Ninsei pavement
and somehow she'd been singled out for him, one face out of
the dozens who stood at the consoles, lost in the game she
played.  The expression on her face, then, had been the one
he'd seen, hours later, on her sleeping face in a portside coffin,
her upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in
flight.
  Crossing the arcade to stand beside her, high on the deal
he'd made, he saw her glance up.  Gray eyes rimmed with
smudged black paintstick.  Eyes of some animal pinned in the
headlights of an oncoming vehicle.
  Their night together stretching into a morning, into tickets
at the hoverport and his first trip across the Bay.  The rain kept
up, falling along Harajuku, beading on her plastic jacket, the
children of Tokyo trooping past the famous boutiques in white
loafers and clingwrap capes, until she'd stood with him in the
midnight clatter of a pachinko parlor and held his hand like a
child.
  It took a month for the gestalt of drugs and tension he moved
through to turn those perpetually startled eyes into wells of
reflexive need.  He'd watched her personality fragment, calving
like an iceberg, splinters drifting away, and finally he'd seen
the raw need, the hungry armature of addiction.  He'd watched
her track the next hit with a concentration that reminded him
of the mantises they sold in stalls along Shiga, beside tanks of
blue mutant carp and crickets caged in bamboo.
  He stared at the black ring of grounds in his empty cup.  It
was vibrating with the speed he'd taken.  The brown laminate
of the tabletop was dull with a patina of tiny scratches.  With
the dex mounting through his spine he saw the countless random
impacts required to create a surface like that.  The Jarre was
decorated in a dated, nameless style from the previous century,
an uneasy blend of Japanese traditional and pale Milanese plas-
tics, but everything seemed to wear a subtle film, as though
the bad nerves of a million customers had somehow attacked
the mirrors and the once glossy plastics, leaving each surface
fogged with something that could never be wiped away.
  `Hey.  Case, good buddy...'
  He looked up, met gray eyes ringed with paintstick.  She
was wearing faded French orbital fatigues and new white sneak-
ers.
  `I been lookin'~ for you, man.'  She took a seat opposite
him, her elbows on the table.  The sleeves of the blue zipsuit
had been ripped out at the shoulders; he automatically checked
her arms for signs of derms or the needle.  `Want a cigarette?'
  She dug a crumpled pack of Yeheyuan filters from an ankle
pocket and offered him one.  He took it, let her light it with a
red plastic tube.  `You sleepin'~ okay, Case?  You look tired.' 
Her accent put her south along the Sprawl, toward Atlanta. 
The skin below her eyes was pale and unhealthy-looking, but
the flesh was still smooth and firm.  She was twenty.  New lines
of pain were starting to etch themselves permanently at the
corners of her mouth.  Her dark hair was drawn back, held by
a band of printed silk.  The pattern might have represented
microcircuits, or a city map.
  `Not if I remember to take my pills,' he said, as a tangible
wave of longing hit him, lust and loneliness riding in on the
wavelength of amphetamine.  He remembered the smell of her
skin in the overheated darkness of a coffin near the port, her
fingers locked across the small of his back.
  All the meat, he thought, and all it wants.
  `Wage,' she said, narrowing her eyes.  `He wants to see
you with a hole in your face.'  She lit her own cigarette.
  `Who says?  Ratz?  You been talking to Ratz?'
  `No.  Mona.  Her new squeeze is one of Wage's boys.'
  `I don't owe him enough.  He does me, he's out the money
anyway.'  He shrugged.
  `Too many people owe him now, Case.  Maybe you get to
be the example.  You seriously better watch it.'
  `Sure.  How about you, Linda?  You got anywhere to sleep?'
  `Sleep.'  She shook her head.  `Sure, Case.'  She shivered,
hunched forward over the table.  Her face was filmed with
sweat.
  `Here,' he said, and dug in the pocket of his windbreaker,
coming up with a crumpled fifty.  He smoothed it automatically,
under the table, folded it in quarters, and passed it to her.
  `You need that, honey.  You better give it to Wage.'  There
was something in the gray eyes now that he couldn't read,
something he'd never seen there before.
  `I owe Wage a lot more than that.  Take it.  I got more
coming,' he lied, as he watched his New Yen vanish into a
zippered pocket.
  `You get your money, Case, you find Wage quick.'
  `I'll see you, Linda,' he said, getting up.
  `Sure.'  A millimeter of white showed beneath each of her
pupils.  Sanpaku.  `You watch your back, man.'
  He nodded, anxious to be gone.
  He looked back as the plastic door swung shut behind him,
saw her eyes reflected in a cage of red neon.

  Friday night on Ninsei.
  He passed yakitori stands and massage parlors, a franchised
coffee shop called Beautiful Girl, the electronic thunder of an
arcade.  He stepped out of the way to let a dark-suited sarariman
by, spotting the Mitsubishi-Genentech logo tattooed across the
back of the man's right hand.
  Was it authentic?  If that's for real, he thought, he's in for
trouble.  If it wasn't, served him right.  M-G employees above
a certain level were implanted with advanced microprocessors
that monitored mutagen levels in the bloodstream.  Gear like
that would get you rolled in Night City, rolled straight into a
black clinic.
  The sarariman had been Japanese, but the Ninsei crowd was
a gaijin crowd.  Groups of sailors up from the port, tense solitary
tourists hunting pleasures no guidebook listed, Sprawl heavies
showing off grafts and implants, and a dozen distinct species
of hustler, all swarming the street in an intricate dance of desire
and commerce.
  There were countless theories explaining why Chiba City
tolerated the Ninsei enclave, but Case tended toward the idea
that the Yakuza might be preserving the place as a kind of
historical park, a reminder of humble origins.  But he also
saw a certain sense in the notion that burgeoning technologies
require outlaw zones, that Night City wasn't there for its in-
habitants, but as a deliberately unsupervised playground for
technology itself.
  Was Linda right, he wondered, staring up at the lights? 
Would Wage have him killed to make an example?  It didn't
make much sense, but then Wage dealt primarily in proscribed
biologicals, and they said you had to be crazy to do that.
  But Linda said Wage wanted him dead.  Case's primary
insight into the dynamics of street dealing was that neither the
buyer nor the seller really needed him.  A middleman's business
is to make himself a necessary evil.  The dubious niche Case
had carved for himself in the criminal ecology of Night City
had been cut out with lies, scooped out a night at a time with
betrayal.  Now, sensing that its walls were starting to crumble,
he felt the edge of a strange euphoria.
  The week before, he'd delayed transfer of a synthetic glan-
dular extract, retailing it for a wider margin than usual.  He
knew Wage hadn't liked that.  Wage was his primary supplier,
nine years in Chiba and one of the few gaijin dealers who'd
managed to forge links with the rigidly stratified criminal es-
tablishment beyond Night City's borders.  Genetic materials and
hormones trickled down to Ninsei along an intricate ladder of
fronts and blinds.  Somehow Wage had managed to trace some-
thing back, once, and now he enjoyed steady connections in a
dozen cities.
  Case found himself staring through a shop window.  The
place sold small bright objects to the sailors.  Watches, flic-
knives, lighters, pocket VTRs, simstim decks, weighted man-
riki chains, and shuriken.  The shuriken had always fascinated
him, steel stars with knife-sharp points.  Some were chromed,
others black, others treated with a rainbow surface like oil on
water.  But the chrome stars held his gaze.  They were mounted
against scarlet ultrasuede with nearly invisible loops of nylon
fishline, their centers stamped with dragons or yinyang sym-
bols.  They caught the street's neon and twisted it, and it came
to Case that these were the stars under which he voyaged, his
destiny spelled out in a constellation of cheap chrome.
  `Julie,' he said to his stars.  `Time to see old Julie.  He'll
know.'

  Julius Deane was one hundred and thirty-five years old, his
metabolism assiduously warped by a weekly fortune in serums
and hormones.  His primary hedge against aging was a yearly
pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons re-set the code
of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba.  Then he'd fly
to Hongkong and order the year's suits and shirts.  Sexless and
inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to lie in
his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship.  Case had never
seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe
seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstructions of gar-
ments of the previous century.  He affected prescription lenses,
framed in spidery gold, ground from thin slabs of pink synthetic
quartz and beveled like the mirrors in a Victorian dollhouse.
  His offices were located in a warehouse behind Ninsei, part
of which seemed to have been sparsely decorated, years before,
with a random collection of European furniture, as though
Deane had once intended to use the place as his home.  Neo- 
Aztec bookcases gathered dust against one wall of the room
where Case waited.  A pair of bulbous Disney-styled table lamps
perched awkwardly on a low Kandinsky-look coffee table in
scarlet-lacquered steel.  A Dali clock hung on the wall between
the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete
floor.  Its hands were holograms that altered to match the con-
volutions of the face as they rotated, but it never told the correct
time.  The room was stacked with white fiberglass shipping
modules that gave off the tang of preserved ginger.
  `You seem to be clean, old son,' said Deane's disembodied
voice.  `Do come in.'
  Magnetic bolts thudded out of position around the massive
imitation-rosewood door to the left of the bookcases.  JULIUS
DEANE IMPORT EXPORT was lettered across the plastic in
peeling self-adhesive capitals.  If the furniture scattered in
Deane's makeshift foyer suggested the end of the past century,
the office itself seemed to belong to its start.
  Deane's seamless pink face regarded Case from a pool of
light cast by an ancient brass lamp with a rectangular shade of
dark green glass.  The importer was securely fenced behind a
vast desk of painted steel, flanked on either side by tall, draw-
ered cabinets made of some sort of pale wood.  The sort of
thing, Case supposed, that had once been used to store written
records of some kind.  The desktop was littered with cassettes,
scrolls of yellowed printout, and various parts of some sort of
clockwork typewriter, a machine Deane never seemed to get
around to reassembling.
  `What brings you around, boyo?' Deane asked, offering
Case a narrow bonbon wrapped in blue-and-white checked pa-
per.  `Try one.  Ting Ting Djahe, the very best.'  Case refused
the ginger, took a seat in a yawing wooden swivel chair, and
ran a thumb down the faded seam of one black jeans-leg.  `Julie,
I hear Wage wants to kill me.'
  `Ah.  Well then.  And where did you hear this, if I may?'
  `People.'
  `People,' Deane said, around a ginger bonbon.  `What sort
of people?  Friends?'
  Case nodded.
  `Not always that easy to know who your friends are, is it?'
  `I do owe him a little money, Deane.  He say anything to
you?'
  `Haven't been in touch, of late.'  Then he sighed.  `If I _did_
know, of course, I might not be in a position to tell you.  Things
being what they are, you understand.'
  `Things?'
  `He's an important connection, Case.'
  `Yeah.  He want to kill me, Julie?'
  `Not that I know of.'  Deane shrugged.  They might have
been discussing the price of ginger.  `If it proves to be an
unfounded rumor, old son, you come back in a week or so and
I'll let you in on a little something out of Singapore.'
  `Out of the Nan Hai Hotel, Bencoolen Street?'
  `Loose lips, old son!'  Deane grinned.  The steel desk was
jammed with a fortune in debugging gear.
  `Be seeing you, Julie.  I'll say hello to Wage.'
  Deane's fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in his
pale silk tie.

  He was less than a block from Deane's office when it hit,
the sudden cellular awareness that someone was on his ass,
and very close.
  The cultivation of a certain tame paranoia was something
Case took for granted.  The trick lay in not letting it get out of
control.  But that could be quite a trick, behind a stack of
octagons.  He fought the adrenaline surge and composed his
narrow features in a mask of bored vacancy, pretending to let
the crowd carry him along.  When he saw a darkened display
window, he managed to pause by it.  The place was a surgical
boutique, closed for renovations.  With his hands in the pockets
of his jacket, he stared through the glass at a flat lozenge of
vatgrown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade. 
The color of its skin reminded him of Zone's whores; it was
tattooed with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous
chip.  Why bother with the surgery, he found himself thinking,
while sweat coursed down his ribs, when you could just carry
the thing around in your pocket?
  Without moving his head, he raised his eyes and studied
the reflection of the passing crowd.
  There.
  Behind sailors in short-sleeved khaki.  Dark hair, mirrored
glasses, dark clothing, slender...
  And gone.
  Then Case was running, bent low, dodging between bodies.

  `Rent me a gun, Shin?'
  The boy smiled.  `Two hour.'  They stood together in the
smell of fresh raw seafood at the rear of a Shiga sushi stall. 
`You come back, two hour.'
  `I need one now, man.  Got anything right now?'
  Shin rummaged behind empty two-liter cans that had once
been filled with powdered horseradish.  He produced a slender
package wrapped in gray plastic.  `Taser.  One hour, twenty
New Yen.  Thirty deposit.'
  `Shit.  I don't need that.  I need a gun.  Like I maybe wanna
shoot somebody, understand?'
  The waiter shrugged, replacing the taser behind the horse-
radish cans.  `Two hour.'

  He went into the shop without bothering to glance at the
display of shuriken.  He'd never thrown one in his life.
  He bought two packs of Yeheyuans with a Mitsubishi Bank
chip that gave his name as Charles Derek May.  It beat Truman
Starr, the best he'd been able to do for a passport.
  The Japanese woman behind the terminal looked like she
had a few years on old Deane, none of them with the benefit
of science.  He took his slender roll of New Yen out of his
pocket and showed it to her.  `I want to buy a weapon.'
  She gestured in the direction of a case filled with knives.
  `No,' he said, `I don't like knives.'
  She brought an oblong box from beneath the counter.  The
lid was yellow cardboard, stamped with a crude image of a
coiled cobra with a swollen hood.  Inside were eight identical
tissue-wrapped cylinders.  He watched while mottled brown
fingers stripped the paper from one.  She held the thing up for
him to examine, a dull steel tube with a leather thong at one
end and a small bronze pyramid at the other.  She gripped the
tube with one hand, the pyramid between her other thumb and
forefinger, and pulled.  Three oiled, telescoping segments of
tightly wound coilspring slid out and locked.  `Cobra,' she said.

  Beyond the neon shudder of Ninsei, the sky was that mean
shade of gray.  The air had gotten worse; it seemed to have
teeth tonight, and half the crowd wore filtration masks.  Case
had spent ten minutes in a urinal, trying to discover a convenient
way to conceal his cobra; finally he'd settled for tucking the
handle into the waistband of his jeans, with the tube slanting
across his stomach.  The pyramidal striking tip rode between
his ribcage and the lining of his windbreaker.  The thing felt
like it might clatter to the pavement with his next step, but it
made him feel better.
  The Chat wasn't really a dealing bar, but on weeknights it
attracted a related clientele.  Fridays and Saturdays were dif-
ferent.  The regulars were still there, most of them, but they
faded behind an influx of sailors and the specialists who preyed
on them.  As Case pushed through the doors, he looked for
Ratz, but the bartender wasn't in sight.  Lonny Zone, the bar's
resident pimp, was observing with glazed fatherly interest as
one of his girls went to work on a young sailor.  Zone was
addicted to a brand of hypnotic the Japanese called Cloud
Dancers.  Catching the pimp's eye, Case beckoned him to the
bar.  Zone came drifting through the crowd in slow motion, his
long face slack and placid.
  `You seen Wage tonight, Lonny?'
  Zone regarded him with his usual calm.  He shook his head.
  `You sure, man?'
  `Maybe in the Namban.  Maybe two hours ago.'
  `Got some joeboys with him?  One of 'em thin, dark hair,
maybe a black jacket?'
  `No,' Zone said at last, his smooth forehead creased to
indicate the effort it cost him to recall so much pointless detail. 
`Big boys.  Graftees.'  Zone's eyes showed very little white and
less iris; under the drooping lids, his pupils were dilated and
enormous.  He stared into Case's face for a long time, then
lowered his gaze.  He saw the bulge of the steel whip.  `Cobra,'
he said, and raised an eyebrow.  `You wanna fuck somebody
up?'
  `See you, Lonny.'  Case left the bar.

  His tail was back.  He was sure of it.  He felt a stab of elation,
the octagons and adrenaline mingling with something else. 
You're enjoying this, he thought; you're crazy.
  Because, in some weird and very approximate way, it was
like a run in the matrix.  Get just wasted enough, find yourself
in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble, and
it was possible to see Ninsei as a field of data, the way the
matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish
cell specialties.  Then you could throw yourself into a highspeed
drift and skid, totally engaged but set apart from it all, and all
around you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made
flesh in the mazes of the black market...
  Go it, Case, he told himself.  Suck 'em in.  Last thing they'll
expect.  He was half a block from the games arcade where he'd
first met Linda Lee.
  He bolted across Ninsei, scattering a pack of strolling sail-
ors.  One of them screamed after him in Spanish.  Then he was
through the entrance, the sound crashing over him like surf,
subsonics throbbing in the pit of his stomach.  Someone scored
a ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated airburst
drowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball
mushroomed overhead.  He cut to the right and loped up a flight
of unpainted chipboard stairs.  He'd come here once with Wage,
to discuss a deal in proscribed hormonal triggers with a man
called Matsuga.  He remembered the hallway, its stained mat-
ting, the row of identical doors leading to tiny office cubicles. 
One door was open now.  A Japanese girl in a sleeveless black
t-shirt glanced up from a white terminal, behind her head a
travel poster of Greece, Aegian blue splashed with streamlined
ideograms.
  `Get your security up here,' Case told her.
  Then he sprinted down the corridor, out of her sight.  The
last two doors were closed and, he assumed, locked.  He spun
and slammed the sole of his nylon running shoe into the blue-
lacquered composition door at the far end.  It popped, cheap
hardware failing from the splintered frame.  Darkness there, the
white curve of a terminal housing.  Then he was on the door
to its right, both hands around the transparent plastic knob,
leaning in with everything he had.  Something snapped, and he
was inside.  This was where he and Wage had met with Mat-
suga, but whatever front company Matsuga had operated was
long gone.  No terminal, nothing.  Light from the alley behind
the arcade, filtering in through sootblown plastic.  He made out
a snakelike loop of fiberoptics protruding from a wall socket,
a pile of discarded food containers, and the bladeless nacelle
of an electric fan.
  The window was a single pane of cheap plastic.  He shrugged
out of his jacket, bundled it around his right hand, and punched. 
It split, requiring two more blows to free it from the frame. 
Over the muted chaos of the games, an alarm began to cycle,
triggered either by the broken window or by the girl at the head
of the corridor.
  Case turned, pulled his jacket on, and flicked the cobra to
full extension.
  With the door closed, he was counting on his tail to assume
he'd gone through the one he'd kicked half off its hinges.  The
cobra's bronze pyramid began to bob gently, the spring-steel
shaft amplifying his pulse.
  Nothing happened.  There was only the surging of the alarm,
the crashing of the games, his heart hammering.  When the fear
came, it was like some half-forgotten friend.  Not the cold,
rapid mechanism of the dex-paranoia, but simple animal fear. 
He'd lived for so long on a constant edge of anxiety that he'd
almost forgotten what real fear was.
  This cubicle was the sort of place where people died.  He
might die here.  They might have guns...
  A crash, from the far end of the corridor.  A man's voice,
shouting something in Japanese.  A scream, shrill terror.  An-
other crash.
  And footsteps, unhurried, coming closer.
  Passing his closed door.  Pausing for the space of three rapid
beats of his heart.  And returning.  One, two, three.  A bootheel
scraped the matting.
  The last of his octagon-induced bravado collapsed.  He
snapped the cobra into its handle and scrambled for the window,
blind with fear, his nerves screaming.  He was up, out, and
falling, all before he was conscious of what he'd done.  The
impact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins.
  A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch
framed a heap of discarded fiberoptics and the chassis of a
junked console.  He'd fallen face forward on a slab of soggy
chipboard; he rolled over, into the shadow of the console.  The
cubicle's window was a square of faint light.  The alarm still
oscillated, louder here, the rear wall dulling the roar of the
games.
  A head appeared, framed in the window, backlit by the
fluorescents in the corridor, then vanished.  It returned, but he
still couldn't read the features.  Glint of silver across the eyes. 
`Shit,' someone said, a woman, in the accent of the northern
Sprawl.
  The head was gone.  Case lay under the console for a long
count of twenty, then stood up.  The steel cobra was still in his
hand, and it took him a few seconds to remember what it was. 
He limped away down the alley, nursing his left ankle.

  Shin's pistol was a fifty-year-old Vietnamese imitation of
a South American copy of a Walther PPK, double-action on
the first shot, with a very rough pull.  It was chambered for .22
long rifle, and Case would've preferred lead azide explosives
to the simple Chinese hollowpoints Shin had sold him.  Still,
it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he
made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in
his jacket pocket.  The grips were bright red plastic molded in
a raised dragon motif, something to run your thumb across
in the dark.  He'd consigned the cobra to a dump canister on
Ninsei and dry-swallowed another octagon.
  The pill lit his circuits and he rode the rush down Shiga to
Ninsei, then over to Baiitsu.  His tail, he'd decided, was gone,
and that was fine.  He had calls to make, biz to transact, and
it wouldn't wait.  A block down Baiitsu, toward the port, stood
a featureless ten-story office building in ugly yellow brick.  Its
windows were dark now, but a faint glow from the roof was
visible if you craned your neck.  An unlit neon sign near the
main entrance offered CHEAP HOTEL under a cluster of ideo-
grams.  If the place had another name, Case didn't know it; it
was always referred to as Cheap Hotel.  You reached it through
an alley off Baiitsu, where an elevator waited at the foot of a
transparent shaft.  The elevator, like Cheap Hotel, was an af-
terthought, lashed to the building with bamboo and epoxy.  Case
climbed into the plastic cage and used his key, an unmarked
length of rigid magnetic tape.
  Case had rented a coffin here, on a weekly basis, since he'd
arrived in Chiba, but he'd never slept in Cheap Hotel.  He slept
in cheaper places.
  The elevator smelled of perfume and cigarettes; the sides
of the cage was scratched and thumb-smudged.  As it passed the
fifth floor, he saw the lights of Ninsei.  He drummed his fingers
against the pistolgrip as the cage slowed with a gradual hiss. 
As always, it came to a full stop with a violent jolt, but he
was ready for it.  He stepped out into the courtyard that served
the place as some combination of lobby and lawn.
  Centered in the square carpet of green plastic turf, a Japanese
teenager sat behind a C-shaped console, reading a textbook. 
The white fiberglass coffins were racked in a framework of
industrial scaffolding.  Six tiers of coffins, ten coffins on a side. 
Case nodded in the boy's direction and limped across the plastic
grass to the nearest ladder.  The compound was roofed with
cheap laminated matting that rattled in a strong wind and leaked
when it rained, but the coffins were reasonably difficult to open
without a key.
  The expansion-grate catwalk vibrated with his weight as he
edged his way along the third tier to Number 92.  The coffins
were three meters long, the oval hatches a meter wide and just
under a meter and a half tall.  He fed his key into the slot and
waited for verification from the house computer.  Magnetic bolts
thudded reassuringly and the hatch rose vertically with a creak
of springs.  Fluorescents flickered on as he crawled in, pulling
the hatch shut behind him and slapping the panel that activated
the manual latch.
  There was nothing in Number 92 but a standard Hitachi
pocket computer and a small white styrofoam cooler chest.  The
cooler contained the remains of three ten-kilo slabs of dry ice,
carefully wrapped in paper to delay evaporation, and a spun
aluminum lab flask.  Crouching on the brown temperfoam slab
that was both floor and bed, Case took Shin's .22 from his
pocket and put it on top of the cooler.  Then he took off his
jacket.  The coffin's terminal was molded into one concave wall,
opposite a panel listing house rules in seven languages.  Case
took the pink handset from its cradle and punched a Hongkong
number from memory.  He let it ring five times, then hung up. 
His buyer for the three megabytes of hot RAM in the Hitachi
wasn't taking calls.
  He punched a Tokyo number in Shinjuku.
  A woman answered, something in Japanese.
  `Snake Man there?'
  `Very good to hear from you,' said Snake Man, coming in
on an extension.  `I've been expecting your call.'
  `I got the music you wanted.'  Glancing at the cooler.
  `I'm very glad to hear that.  We have a cash flow problem. 
Can you front?'
  `Oh, man, I really need the money bad...'
  Snake Man hung up.
  `You shit,' Case said to the humming receiver.  He stared
at the cheap little pistol.
  `Iffy,' he said, `it's all looking very iffy tonight.'

  Case walked into the Chat an hour before dawn, both hands
in the pockets of his jacket: one held the rented pistol, the other
the aluminum flask.
  Ratz was at a rear table, drinking Apollonaris water from
a beer pitcher, his hundred and twenty kilos of doughy flesh
tilted against the wall on a creaking chair.  A Brazilian kid
called Kurt was on the bar, tending a thin crowd of mostly
silent drunks.  Ratz's plastic arm buzzed as he raised the pitcher
and drank.  His shaven head was filmed with sweat.  `You look
bad, friend artiste,' he said, flashing the wet ruin of his teeth.
  `I'm doing just fine,' said Case, and grinned like a skull. 
`Super fine.'  He sagged into the chair opposite Ratz, hands
still in his pockets.
  `And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter
built of booze and ups, sure.  Proof against the grosser emotions,
yes?'
  `Why don't you get off my case, Ratz?  You seen Wage?'
  `Proof against fear and being alone,' the bartender contin-
ued.  `Listen to the fear.  Maybe it's your friend.'
  `You hear anything about a fight in the arcade tonight, Ratz? 
Somebody hurt?'
  `Crazy cut a security man.'  He shrugged.  `A girl, they
say.'
  `I gotta talk to Wage.  Ratz, I...'
  `Ah.'  Ratz's mouth narrowed, compressed into a single
line.  He was looking past Case, toward the entrance.  `I think
you are about to.'
  Case had a sudden flash of the shuriken in their window. 
The speed sang in his head.  The pistol in his hand was slippery
with sweat.
  `Herr Wage,' Ratz said, slowly extending his pink manip-
ulator as if he expected it to be shaken.  `How great a pleasure. 
Too seldom do you honor us.'
  Case turned his head and looked up into Wage's face.  It
was a tanned and forgettable mask.  The eyes were vatgrown
sea-green Nikon transplants.  Wage wore a suit of gunmetal
silk and a simple bracelet of platinum on either wrist.  He was
flanked by his joeboys, nearly identical young men, their arms
and shoulders bulging with grafted muscle.
  `How you doing, Case?'
  `Gentlemen,' said Ratz, picking up the table's heaped ash-
tray in his pink plastic claw, `I want no trouble here.'  The
ashtray was made of thick, shatterproof plastic, and advertised
Tsingtao beer.  Ratz crushed it smoothly, butts and shards of
green plastic cascading onto the tabletop.  `You understand?'
  `Hey, sweetheart,' said one of the joeboys, `you wanna try
that thing on me?'
  `Don't bother aiming for the legs, Kurt,' Ratz said, his tone
conversational.  Case glanced across the room and saw the Bra-
zilian standing on the bar, aiming a Smith & Wesson riot gun
at the trio.  The thing's barrel, made of paper-thin alloy wrapped
with a kilometer of glass filament, was wide enough to swallow
a fist.  The skeletal magazine revealed five fat orange cartridges,
subsonic sandbag jellies.
  `Technically nonlethal,' said Ratz.
  `Hey, Ratz,' Case said, `I owe you one.'
  The bartender shrugged.  `Nothing, you owe me.  These,'
and he glowered at Wage and the joeboys, `should know better. 
You don't take anybody off in the Chatsubo.'
  Wage coughed.  `So who's talking about taking anybody
off.  We just wanna talk business.  Case and me, we work
together.'
  Case pulled the .22 out of his pocket and levelled it at
Wage's crotch.  `I hear you wanna do me.'  Ratz's pink claw
closed around the pistol and Case let his hand go limp.
  `Look, Case, you tell me what the fuck is going on with
you, you wig or something?  What's this shit I'm trying to kill
you?'  Wage turned to the boy on his left.  `You two go back
to the Namban.  Wait for me.'
  Case watched as they crossed the bar, which was now en-
tirely deserted except for Kurt and a drunken sailor in khakis,
who was curled at the foot of a barstool.  The barrel of the
Smith & Wesson tracked the two to the door, then swung back
to cover Wage.  The magazine of Case's pistol clattered on the
table.  Ratz held the gun in his claw and pumped the round out
of the chamber.
  `Who told you I was going to hit you, Case?' Wage asked.
  Linda.
  `Who told you, man?  Somebody trying to set you up?'
  The sailor moaned and vomited explosively.
  `Get him out of here,' Ratz called to Kurt, who was sitting
on the edge of the bar now, the Smith & Wesson across his
lap, lighting a cigarette.
  Case felt the weight of the night come down on him like a
bag of wet sand settling behind his eyes.  He took the flask out
of his pocket and handed it to Wage.  `All I got.  Pituitaries. 
Get you five hundred if you move it fast.  Had the rest of my
roll in some RAM, but that's gone by now.'
  `You okay, Case?'  The flask had already vanished behind
a gunmetal lapel.  `I mean, fine, this'll square us, but you look
bad.  Like hammered shit.  You better go somewhere and sleep.'
  `Yeah.'  He stood up and felt the Chat sway around him. 
`Well, I had this fifty, but I gave it to somebody.'  He giggled. 
He picked up the .22's magazine and the one loose cartridge
and dropped them into one pocket, then put the pistol in the
other.  `I gotta see Shin, get my deposit back.'
  `Go home,' said Ratz, shifting on the creaking chair with
something like embarrassment.  `Artiste.  Go home.'
  He felt them watching as he crossed the room and shouldered
his way past the plastic doors.

  `Bitch,' he said to the rose tint over Shiga.  Down on Ninsei
the holograms were vanishing like ghosts, and most of the neon
was already cold and dead.  He sipped thick black coffee from
a street vendor's foam thimble and watched the sun come up. 
`You fly away, honey.  Towns like this are for people who like
the way down.'  But that wasn't it, really, and he was finding
it increasingly hard to maintain the sense of betrayal.  She just
wanted a ticket home, and the RAM in his Hitachi would buy
it for her, if she could find the right fence.  And that business
with the fifty; she'd almost turned it down, knowing she was
about to rip him for the rest of what he had.
  When he climbed out of the elevator, the same boy was on
the desk.  Different textbook.  `Good buddy,' Case called across
the plastic turf, `you don't need to tell me.  I know already. 
Pretty lady came to visit, said she had my key.  Nice little tip
for you, say fifty New ones?'  The boy put down his book. 
`Woman,' Case said, and drew a line across his forehead with
his thumb.  `Silk.'  He smiled broadly.  The boy smiled back,
nodded.  `Thanks, asshole,' Case said.
  On the catwalk, he had trouble with the lock.  She'd messed
it up somehow when she'd fiddled it, he thought.  Beginner. 
He knew where to rent a blackbox that would open anything
in Cheap Hotel.  Fluorescents came on as he crawled in.
  `Close the hatch real slow, friend.  You still got that Saturday
night special you rented from the waiter?'
  She sat with her back to the wall, at the far end of the coffin. 
She had her knees up, resting her wrists on them; the pepperbox
muzzle of a flechette pistol emerged from her hands.
  `That you in the arcade?'  He pulled the hatch down. 
`Where's Linda?'
  `Hit that latch switch.'
  He did.
  `That your girl?  Linda?'
  He nodded.
  `She's gone.  Took your Hitachi.  Real nervous kid.  What
about the gun, man?'  She wore mirrored glasses.  Her clothes
were black, the heels of black boots deep in the temperfoam.
  `I took it back to Shin, got my deposit.  Sold his bullets
back to him for half what I paid.  You want the money?'
  `No.'
  `Want some dry ice?  All I got, right now.'
  `What got into you tonight?  Why'd you pull that scene at
the arcade?  I had to mess up this rentacop came after me with
nunchucks.'
  `Linda said you were gonna kill me.'
  `Linda said?  I never saw her before I came up here.'
  `You aren't with Wage?'
  She shook her head.  He realized that the glasses were sur-
gically inset, sealing her sockets.  The silver lenses seemed to
grow from smooth pale skin above her cheekbones, framed by
dark hair cut in a rough shag.  The fingers curled around the
fletcher were slender, white, tipped with polished burgundy. 
The nails looked artificial.  `I think you screwed up, Case.  I
showed up and you just fit me right into your reality picture.'
  `So what do you want, lady?'  He sagged back against the
hatch.
  `You.  One live body, brains still somewhat intact.  Molly,
Case.  My name's Molly.  I'm collecting you for the man I work
for.  Just wants to talk; is all.  Nobody wants to hurt you.'
  `That's good.'
  `'Cept I do hurt people sometimes, Case.  I guess it's just
the way I'm wired.'  She wore tight black gloveleather jeans
and a bulky black jacket cut from some matte fabric that seemed
to absorb light.  `If I put this dartgun away, will you be easy,
Case?  You look like you like to take stupid chances.'
  `Hey, I'm very easy.  I'm a pushover, no problem.'
  `That's fine, man.'  The fletcher vanished into the black
jacket.  `Because you try to fuck around with me, you'll be
taking one of the stupidest chances of your whole life.'
  She held out her hands, palms up, the white fingers slightly
spread, and with a barely audible click, ten double-edged, four-
centimeter scalpel blades slid from their housings beneath the
burgundy nails.
  She smiled.  The blades slowly withdrew.



        2

  After a year of coffins, the room on the twenty-fifth floor
of the Chiba Hilton seemed enormous.  It was ten meters by
eight, half of a suite.  A white Braun coffeemaker steamed on
a low table by the sliding glass panels that opened onto a narrow
balcony.
  `Get some coffee in you.  Look like you need it.'  She took
off her black jacket; the fletcher hung beneath her arm in a
black nylon shoulder rig.  She wore a sleeveless gray pullover
with plain steel zips across each shoulder.  Bulletproof.  Case
decided, slopping coffee into a bright red mug.  His arms and
legs felt like they were made out of wood.
  `Case.'  He looked up, seeing the man for the first time. 
`My name is Armitage.'  The dark robe was open to the waist,
the broad chest hairless and muscular, the stomach flat and
hard.  Blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach.  `Sun's
up, Case.  This is your lucky day, boy.'
  Case whipped his arm sideways and the man easily ducked
the scalding coffee.  Brown stain running down the imitation
ricepaper wall.  He saw the angular gold ring through the left
lobe.  Special Forces.  The man smiled.
  `Get your coffee, Case,' Molly said.  `You re okay, but
you're not going anywhere 'til Armitage has his say.'  She sat
crosslegged on a silk futon and began to fieldstrip the fletcher
without bothering to look at it.  Twin mirrors tracking as he
crossed to the table and refilled his cup.
  `Too young to remember the war, aren't you, Case?'  Ar-
mitage ran a large hand back through his cropped brown hair. 
A heavy gold bracelet flashed on his wrist.  `Leningrad, Kiev,
Siberia.  We invented you in Siberia, Case.'
  `What's that supposed to mean?'
  `Screaming Fist, Case.  You've heard the name.'
  `Some kind of run, wasn't it?  Tried to burn this Russian
nexus with virus programs.  Yeah, I heard about it.  And nobody
got out.'
  He sensed abrupt tension.  Armitage walked to the window
and looked out over Tokyo Bay.  `That isn't true.  One unit
made it back to Helsinki, Case.'
  Case shrugged, sipped coffee.
  `You're a console cowboy.  The prototypes of the programs
you use to crack industrial banks were developed for Screaming
Fist.  For the assault on the Kirensk computer nexus.  Basic
module was a Nightwing microlight, a pilot, a matrix deck, a
jockey.  We were running a virus called Mole.  The Mole series
was the first generation of real intrusion programs.'
  `Icebreakers,' Case said, over the rim of the red mug.
  `Ice from _ICE,_ intrusion countermeasures electronics.'
  `Problem is, mister, I'm no jockey now, so I think I'll just
be going...'
  `I was there, Case; I was there when they invented your
kind.'
  `You got zip to do with me and my kind buddy.  You're
rich enough to hire expensive razorgirls to haul my ass up here,
is all.  I'm never gonna punch any deck again, not for you or
anybody else.'  He crossed to the window and looked down. 
`That's where I live now.'
  `Our profile says you're trying to con the street into killing
you when you're not looking.'
  `Profile?'
  `We've built up a detailed model.  Bought a go-to for each
of your aliases and ran the skim through some military software. 
You're suicidal, Case.  The model gives you a month on the
outside.  And our medical projection says you'll need a new
pancreas inside a year.'
  ``We.''  He met the faded blue eyes.  ``We' who?'
  `What would you say if I told you we could correct your
neural damage, Case?'  Armitage suddenly looked to Case as
if he were carved from a block of metal; inert, enormously
heavy.  A statue.  He knew now that this was a dream, and that
soon he'd wake.  Armitage wouldn't speak again.  Case's dreams
always ended in these freezeframes, and now this one was
over.
  `What would you say, Case?'
  Case looked out over the Bay and shivered.
  `I'd say you were full of shit.'
  Armitage nodded.
  `Then I'd ask what your terms were.'
  `Not very different than what you're used to, Case.'
  `Let the man get some sleep, Armitage,' Molly said from
her futon, the components of the fletcher spread on the silk
like some expensive puzzle.  `He's coming apart at the seams.'
  `Terms,' Case said, `and now.  Right now.'
  He was still shivering.  He couldn't stop shivering.

  The clinic was nameless, expensively appointed, a cluster
of sleek pavilions separated by small formal gardens.  He re-
membered the place from the round he'd made his first month
in Chiba.
  `Scared, Case.  You're real scared.'  It was Sunday afternoon
and he stood with Molly in a sort of courtyard.  White boulders,
a stand of green bamboo, black gravel raked into smooth waves. 
A gardener, a thing like a large metal crab, was tending the
bamboo.
  `It'll work Case.  You got no idea, the kind of stuff Ar-
mitage has.  Like he's gonna pay these nerve boys for fixing
you with the program he's giving them to tell them how to do
it.  He'll put them three years ahead of the competition.  You
got any idea what that's worth?'  She hooked thumbs in the
beltloops of her leather jeans and rocked backward on the
lacquered heels of cherry red cowboy boots.  The narrow toes
were sheathed in bright Mexican silver.  The lenses were empty
quicksilver, regarding him with an insect calm.
  `You're street samurai,' he said.  `How long you work for
him?'
  `Couple of months.'
  `What about before that?'
  `For somebody else.  Working girl, you know?'
  He nodded.
  `Funny, Case.'
  `What's funny?'
  `It's like I know you.  That profile he's got.  I know how
you're wired.'
  `You don't know me, sister.'
  `You're okay, Case.  What got you, it's just called bad luck.'
  `How about him?  He okay, Molly?'  The robot crab moved
toward them, picking its way over the waves of gravel.  Its
bronze carapace might have been a thousand years old.  When
it was within a meter of her boots, it fired a burst of light, then
froze for an instant, analyzing data obtained.
  `What I always think about first, Case, is my own sweet
ass.'  The crab had altered course to avoid her, but she kicked
it with a smooth precision, the silver boot-tip clanging on the
carapace.  The thing fell on its back, but the bronze limbs soon
righted it.
  Case sat on one of the boulders, scuffing at the symmetry
of the gravel waves with the toes of his shoes.  He began to
search his pockets for cigarettes.  `In your shirt,' she said.
  `You want to answer my question?'  He fished a wrinkled
Yeheyuan from the pack and she lit it for him with a thin slab
of German steel that looked as though it belonged on an op-
erating table.
  `Well, I'll tell you, the man's definitely on to something. 
He's got big money now, and he's never had it before, and he
gets more all the time.'  Case noticed a certain tension around
her mouth.  `Or maybe, maybe something's on to him...' 
She shrugged.
  `What's that mean?'
  `I don't know, exactly.  I know I don't know who or what
we're really working for.'
  He stared at the twin mirrors.  Leaving the Hilton, Saturday
morning, he'd gone back to Cheap Hotel and slept for ten hours. 
Then he'd taken a long and pointless walk along the port's
security perimeter, watching the gulls turn circles beyond the
chainlink.  If she'd followed him, she'd done a good job of it. 
He'd avoided Night City.  He'd waited in the coffin for Ar-
mitage's call.  Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this
girl with a gymnast's body and conjurer's hands.
  `If you'll come in now, sir, the anesthetist is waiting to
meet you.'  The technician bowed, turned, and reentered the
clinic without waiting to see if Case would follow.

  Cold steel odor.  Ice caressed his spine.
  Lost, so small amid that dark, hands grown cold, body image
fading down corridors of television sky.
  Voices.
  Then black fire found the branching tributaries of the nerves,
pain beyond anything to which the name of pain is given...

  Hold still.  Don't move.
  And Ratz was there, and Linda Lee, Wage and Lonny Zone,
a hundred faces from the neon forest, sailors and hustlers and
whores, where the sky is poisoned silver, beyond chainlink
and the prison of the skull.
  Goddamn don't you move.
  Where the sky faded from hissing static to the noncolor of
the matrix, and he glimpsed the shuriken, his stars.
  `Stop it, Case, I gotta find your vein!'
  She was straddling his chest, a blue plastic syrette in one
hand.  `You don't lie still, I'll slit your fucking throat.  You're
still full of endorphin inhibitors.'

  He woke and found her stretched beside him in the dark.
  His neck was brittle, made of twigs.  There was a steady
pulse of pain midway down his spine.  Images formed and
reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl's towers and
ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the
shade beneath a bridge or overpass...
  `Case?  It's Wednesday, Case.'  She moved, rolling over,
reaching across him.  A breast brushed his upper arm.  He heard
her tear the foil seal from a bottle of water and drink.  `Here.' 
She put the bottle in his hand.  `I can see in the dark, Case. 
Microchannel image-amps in my glasses.'
  `My back hurts.'
  `That's where they replaced your fluid.  Changed your blood,
too.  Blood 'cause you got a new pancreas thrown into the deal. 
And some new tissue patched into your liver.  The nerve stuff,
I dunno.  Lot of injections.  They didn't have to open anything
up for the main show.'  She settled back beside him.  `It's
2:43:12 AM, Case.  Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve.'
  He sat up and tried to sip from the bottle.  Gagged, coughed,
lukewarm water spraying his chest and thighs.
  `I gotta punch deck,' he heard himself say.  He was groping
for his clothes.  `I gotta know...'
  She laughed.  Small strong hands gripped his upper arms. 
`Sorry, hotshot.  Eight day wait.  Your nervous system would
fall out on the floor if you jacked in now.  Doctor's orders. 
Besides, they figure it worked.  Check you in a day or so.'  He
lay down again.
  `Where are we?'
  `Home.  Cheap Hotel.'
  `Where's Armitage?'
  `Hilton, selling beads to the natives or something.  We're
out of here soon, man.  Amsterdam, Paris, then back to the
Sprawl.'  She touched his shoulder.  `Roll over.  I give a good
massage.'
  He lay on his stomach, arms stretched forward, tips of his
fingers against the walls of the coffin.  She settled over the
small of his back, kneeling on the temperfoam, the leather
jeans cool against his skin.  Her fingers brushed his neck.
  `How come you're not at the Hilton?'
  She answered him by reaching back, between his thighs,
and gently encircling his scrotum with thumb and forefinger. 
She rocked there for a minute in the dark, erect above him,
her other hand on his neck.  The leather of her jeans creaked
softly with the movement.  Case shifted, feeling himself harden
against the temperfoam.
  His head throbbed, but the brittleness in his neck seemed
to retreat.  He raised himself on one elbow, rolled, sank back
against the foam, pulling her down, licking her breasts, small
hard nipples sliding wet across his cheek.  He found the zip on
the leather jeans and tugged it down.
  `It's okay,' she said, `I can see.'  Sound of the jeans peeling
down.  She struggled beside him until she could kick them away. 
She threw a leg across him and he touched her face.  Unexpected
hardness of the implanted lenses.  `Don't,' she said, `finger-
prints.'
  Now she straddled him again, took his hand, and closed it
over her, his thumb along the cleft of her buttocks, his fingers
spread across the labia.  As she began to lower herself, the
images came pulsing back, the faces, fragments of neon arriv-
ing and receding.  She slid down around him and his back arched
convulsively.  She rode him that way, impaling herself, slipping
down on him again and again, until they both had come, his
orgasm flaring blue in a timeless space, a vastness like the
matrix, where the faces were shredded and blown away down
hurricane corridors, and her inner thighs were strong and wet
against his hips.

  On Ninsei, a thinner, weekday version of the crowd went
through the motions of the dance.  Waves of sound rolled from
the arcades and pachinko parlors.  Case glanced into the Chat
and saw Zone watching over his girls in the warm, beer-smell-
ing twilight.  Ratz was tending bar.
  `You seen Wage, Ratz?'
  `Not tonight.'  Ratz made a point of raising an eyebrow at
Molly.
  `You see him, tell him I got his money.'
  `Luck changing, my artiste?'
  `Too soon to tell.'

  `Well, I gotta see this guy,' Case said, watching his re-
flection in her glasses.  `I got biz to cancel out of.'
  `Armitage won't like it, I let you out of my sight.'  She
stood beneath Deane's melting clock, hands on her hips.
  `The guy won't talk to me if you're there.  Deane I don't
give two shits about.  He takes care of himself.  But I got people
who'll just go under if I walk out of Chiba cold.  It's my people,
you know?'
  Her mouth hardened.  She shook her head.
  `I got people in Singapore, Tokyo connections in Shinjuku
and Asakuza, and they'll go _down,_ understand?' he lied, his
hand on the shoulder of her black jacket.  `Five.  Five minutes. 
By your clock, okay?'
  `Not what I'm paid for.'
  `What you're paid for is one thing.  Me letting some tight
friends die because you're too literal about your instructions is
something else.'
  `Bullshit.  Tight friends my ass.  You're going in there to
check us out with your smuggler.'  She put a booted foot up
on the dust-covered Kandinsky coffee table.
  `Ah, Case, sport, it does look as though your companion
there is definitely armed, aside from having a fair amount of
silicon in her head.  What is this about, exactly?'  Deane's ghostly
cough seemed to hang in the air between them.
  `Hold on, Julie.  Anyway, I'll be coming in alone.'
  `You can be sure of that, old son.  Wouldn't have it any
other way.'
  `Okay,' she said.  `Go.  But five minutes.  Any more and
I'll come in and cool your tight friend permanently.  And while
you're at it, you try to figure something out.'
  `What's that?'
  `Why I'm doing you the favor.'  She turned and walked
out, past the stacked white modules of preserved ginger.
  `Keeping stranger company than usual, Case?' asked Julie.
  `Julie, she's gone.  You wanna let me in?  Please, Julie?'
  The bolts worked.  `Slowly, Case,' said the voice.
  `Turn on the works, Julie, all the stuff in the desk,' Case
said, taking his place in the swivel chair.
  `It's on all the time,' Deane said mildly, taking a gun from
behind the exposed works of his old mechanical typewriter and
aiming it carefully at Case.  It was a belly gun, a magnum
revolver with the barrel sawn down to a nub.  The front of the
trigger guard had been cut away and the grips wrapped with
what looked like old masking tape.  Case thought it looked very
strange in Dean's manicured pink hands.  `Just taking care, you
understand.  Nothing personal.  Now tell me what you want.'
  `I need a history lesson, Julie.  And a go-to on somebody.'
  `What's moving, old son?'  Deane's shirt was candy-striped
cotton, the collar white and rigid, like porcelain.
  `Me, Julie.  I'm leaving.  Gone.  But do me the favor, okay?'
  `Go-to on whom, old son?'
  `Gaijin name of Armitage, suite in the Hilton.'
  Deane put the pistol down.  `Sit still, Case.'  He tapped
something out on a lap terminal.  `It seems as though you know
as much as my net does, Case.  This gentleman seems to have
a temporary arrangement with the Yakuza, and the sons of the
neon chrysanthemum have ways of screening their allies from
the likes of me.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  Now, history. 
You said history.'  He picked up the gun again, but didn't point
it directly at Case.  `What sort of history?'
  `The war.  You in the war, Julie?'
  `The war?  What's there to know?  Lasted three weeks.'
  `Screaming Fist.'
  `Famous.  Don't they teach you history these days?  Great
bloody postwar political football, that was.  Watergated all to
hell and back.  Your brass, Case, your Sprawlside brass in,
where was it, McLean?  In the bunkers, all of that... great
scandal.  Wasted a fair bit of patriotic young flesh in order to
test some new technology.  They knew about the Russians'~ de-
fenses, it came out later.  Knew about the emps, magnetic pulse
weapons.  Sent these fellows in regardless, just to see.'  Deane
shrugged.  `Turkey shoot for Ivan.'
  `Any of those guys make it out?'
  `Christ,' Deane said, `it's been bloody years...  Though
I do think a few did.  One of the teams.  Got hold of a Sov
gunship.  Helicopter, you know.  Flew it back to Finland.  Didn't
have entry codes, of course, and shot hell out of the Finnish
defense forces in the process.  Special Forces types.'  Deane
sniffed.  `Bloody hell.'
  Case nodded.  The smell of preserved ginger was over-
whelming.
  `I spent the war in Lisbon, you know,' Deane said, putting
the gun down.  `Lovely place, Lisbon.'
  `In the service, Julie?'
  `Hardly.  Though I did see action.'  Deane smiled his pink
smile.  `Wonderful what a war can do for one's markets.'
  `Thanks, Julie.  I owe you one.'
  `Hardly, Case.  And goodbye.'

  And later he'd tell himself that the evening at Sammi's had
felt wrong from the start, that even as he'd followed Molly
along that corridor, shuffling through a trampled mulch of ticket
stubs and styrofoam cups, he'd sensed it.  Linda's death, wait-
ing...
  They'd gone to the Namban, after he'd seen Deane, and
paid off his debt to Wage with a roll of Armitage's New Yen. 
Wage had liked that, his boys had liked it less, and Molly had
grinned at Case's side with a kind of ecstatic feral intensity,
obviously longing for one of them to make a move.  Then he'd
taken her back to the Chat for a drink.
  `Wasting your time, cowboy,' Molly said, when Case took
an octagon from the pocket of his jacket.
  `How's that?  You want one?'  He held the pill out to her.
  `Your new pancreas, Case, and those plugs in your liver. 
Armitage had them designed to bypass that shit.'  She tapped
the octagon with one burgundy nail.  `You're biochemically
incapable of getting off on amphetamine or cocaine.'
  `Shit,' he said.  He looked at the octagon, then at her.
  `Eat it.  Eat a dozen.  Nothing'll happen.'
  He did.  Nothing did.
  Three beers later, she was asking Ratz about the fights.
  `Sammi's,' Ratz said.
  `I'll pass,' Case said, `I hear they kill each other down
there.'
  An hour later, she was buying tickets from a skinny Thai
in a white t-shirt and baggy rugby shorts.
  Sammi's was an inflated dome behind a portside warehouse,
taut gray fabric reinforced with a net of thin steel cables.  The
corridor, with a door at either end, was a crude airlock pre-
serving the pressure differential that supported the dome.  Flu-
orescent rings were screwed to the plywood ceiling at intervals,
but most of them had been broken.  The air was damp and close
with the smell of sweat and concrete.
  None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the
tense hush, the towering puppets of light beneath the dome. 
Concrete sloped away in tiers to a kind of central stage, a raised
circle ringed with a glittering thicket of projection gear.  No
light but the holograms that shifted and flickered above the
ring, reproducing the movements of the two men below.  Strata
of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck
currents set up by the blowers that supported the dome.  No
sound but the muted purring of the blowers and the amplified
breathing of the fighters.
  Reflected colors flowed across Molly's lenses as the men
circled.  The holograms were ten-power magnifications; at ten,
the knives they held were just under a meter long.  The knife-
fighter's grip is the fencer's grip, Case remembered, the fingers
curled, thumb aligned with blade.  The knives seemed to move
of their own accord, gliding with a ritual lack of urgency through
the arcs and passes of their dance, point passing point, as the
men waited for an opening.  Molly's upturned face was smooth
and still, watching.
  `I'll go find us some food,' Case said.  She nodded, lost in
contemplation of the dance.
  He didn't like this place.
  He turned and walked back into the shadows.  Too dark. 
Too quiet.
  The crowd, he saw, was mostly Japanese.  Not really a Night
City crowd.  Techs down from the arcologies.  He supposed that
meant the arena had the approval of some corporate recreational
committee.  He wondered briefly what it would be like, working
all your life for one zaibatsu.  Company housing, company
hymn, company funeral.
  He'd made nearly a full circuit of the dome before he found
the food stalls.  He bought yakitori on skewers and two tall
waxy cartons of beer.  Glancing up at the holograms, he saw
that blood laced one figure's chest.  Thick brown sauce trickled
down the skewers and over his knuckles.
  Seven days and he'd jack in.  If he closed his eyes now,
he'd see the matrix.
  Shadows twisted as the holograms swung through their dance.
  Then the fear began to knot between his shoulders.  A cold
trickle of sweat worked its way down and across his ribs.  The
operation hadn't worked.  He was still here, still meat, no Molly
waiting, her eyes locked on the circling knives, no Armitage
waiting in the Hilton with tickets and a new passport and
money.  It was all some dream, some pathetic fantasy...  Hot
tears blurred his vision.
  Blood sprayed from a jugular in a red gout of light.  And
now the crowd was screaming, rising, screaming -- as one fig-
ure crumpled, the hologram fading, flickering...
  Raw edge of vomit in his throat.  He closed his eyes, took
a deep breath, opened them, and saw Linda Lee step past him,
her gray eyes blind with fear.  She wore the same French fa-
tigues.
  And gone.  Into shadow.
  Pure mindless reflex: he threw the beer and chicken down
and ran after her.  He might have called her name, but he'd
never be sure.
  Afterimage of a single hair-fine line of red light.  Seared
concrete beneath the thin soles of his shoes.
  Her white sneakers flashing, close to the curving wall now,
and again the ghost line of the laser branded across his eye,
bobbing in his vision as he ran.
  Someone tripped him.  Concrete tore his palms.
  He rolled and kicked, failing to connect.  A thin boy, spiked
blond hair lit from behind in a rainbow nimbus, was leaning
over him.  Above the stage, a figure turned, knife held high,
to the cheering crowd.  The boy smiled and drew something
from his sleeve.  A razor, etched in red as a third beam blinked
past them into the dark.  Case saw the razor dipping for his
throat like a dowser's wand.
  The face was erased in a humming cloud of microscopic
explosions.  Molly's fletchettes, at twenty rounds per second. 
The boy coughed once, convulsively, and toppled across Case's
legs.
  He was walking toward the stalls, into the shadows.  He
looked down, expecting to see that needle of ruby emerge from
his chest.  Nothing.  He found her.  She was thrown down at the
foot of a concrete pillar, eyes closed.  There was a smell of
cooked meat.  The crowd was chanting the winner's name.  A
beer vendor was wiping his taps with a dark rag.  One white
sneaker had come off, somehow, and lay beside her head.
  Follow the wall.  Curve of concrete.  Hands in pockets.  Keep
walking.  Past unseeing faces, every eye raised to the victor's
image above the ring.  Once a seamed European face danced
in the glare of a match, lips pursed around the short stem of a
metal pipe.  Tang of hashish.  Case walked on, feeling nothing.
  `Case.'  Her mirrors emerged from deeper shadow.  `You
okay?'
  Something mewled and bubbled in the dark behind her.
  He shook his head.
  `Fight's over, Case.  Time to go home.'
  He tried to walk past her, back into the dark, where some-
thing was dying.  She stopped him with a hand on his chest. 
`Friends of your tight friend.  Killed your girl for you.  You
haven't done too well for friends in this town, have you?  We
got a partial profile on that old bastard when we did you, man. 
He'd fry anybody, for a few New ones.  The one back there
said they got on to her when she was trying to fence your RAM. 
Just cheaper for them to kill her and take it.  Save a little
money...  I got the one who had the laser to tell me all about
it.  Coincidence we were here, but I had to make sure.'  Her
mouth was hard, lips pressed into a thin line.
  Case felt as though his brain were jammed.  `Who,' he said,
`who sent them?'
  She passed him a blood-flecked bag of preserved ginger. 
He saw that her hands were sticky with blood.  Back in the
shadows, someone made wet sounds and died.

  After the postoperative check at the clinic, Molly took him
to the port.  Armitage was waiting.  He'd chartered a hovercraft. 
The last Case saw of Chiba were the dark angles of the arcol-
ogies.  Then a mist closed over the black water and the drifting
shoals of waste.



        PART TWO
        THE SHOPPING EXPEDITION


        3

  Home.
  Home was BAMA, the Sprawl, the Boston-Atlanta Met-
ropolitan Axis.
  Program a map to display frequency of data exchange, every
thousand megabytes a single pixel on a very large screen. 
Manhattan and Atlanta burn solid white.  Then they start to
pulse, the rate of traffic threatening to overload your simulation. 
Your map is about to go nova.  Cool it down.  Up your scale. 
Each pixel a million megabytes.  At a hundred million mega-
bytes per second, you begin to make out certain blocks in
midtown Manhattan, outlines of hundred-year-old industrial
parks ringing the old core of Atlanta...

  Case woke from a dream of airports, of Molly's dark leathers
moving ahead of him through the concourses of Narita, Schipol,
Orly...  He watched himself buy a flat plastic flask of Danish
vodka at some kiosk, an hour before dawn.
  Somewhere down in the Sprawl's ferro-concrete roots, a
train drove a column of stale air through a tunnel.  The train
itself was silent, gliding over its induction cushion, but dis-
placed air made the tunnel sing, bass down into subsonics. 
Vibration reached the room where he lay and caused dust to
rise from the cracks in the dessicated parquet floor.
  Opening his eyes, he saw Molly, naked and just out of reach
across an expanse of very new pink temperfoam.  Overhead,
sunlight filtered through the soot-stained grid of a skylight. 
One half-meter square of glass had been replaced with chip-
board, a fat gray cable emerging there to dangle within a few
centimeters of the floor.  He lay on his side and watched her
breathe, her breasts, the sweep of a flank defined with the
functional elegance of a war plane's fusilage.  Her body was
spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer's.
  The room was large.  He sat up.  The room was empty, aside
from the wide pink bedslab and two nylon bags, new and
identical, that lay beside it.  Blank walls, no windows, a single
white-painted steel firedoor.  The walls were coated with count-
less layers of white latex paint.  Factory space.  He knew this
kind of room, this kind of building; the tenants would operate
in the interzone where art wasn't quite crime, crime not quite
art.
  He was home.
  He swung his feet to the floor.  It was made of little blocks
of wood, some missing, others loose.  His head ached.  He
remembered Amsterdam, another room, in the Old City section
of the Centrum, buildings centuries old.  Molly back from the
canal's edge with orange juice and eggs.  Armitage off on some
cryptic foray, the two of them walking alone past Dam Square
to a bar she knew on a Damrak thoroughfare.  Paris was a
blurred dream.  Shopping.  She'd taken him shopping.
  He stood, pulling on a wrinkled pair of new black jeans that
lay at his feet, and knelt beside the bags.  The first one he
opened was Molly's: neatly folded clothing and small expen-
sive-looking gadgets.  The second was stuffed with things he
didn't remember buying: books, tapes, a simstim deck, clothing
with French and Italian labels.  Beneath a green t-shirt, he
discovered a flat, origami-wrapped package, recycled Japanese
paper.
  The paper tore when he picked it up; a bright nine-pointed
star fell -- to stick upright in a crack in the parquet.
  `Souvenir,' Molly said.  `I noticed you were always looking
at 'em.'  He turned and saw her sitting crosslegged on the bed,
sleepily scratching her stomach with burgundy nails.

  `Someone's coming later to secure the place,' Armitage
said.  He stood in the open doorway with an old-fashioned
magnetic key in his hand.  Molly was making coffee on a tiny
German stove she took from her bag.
  `I can do it,' she said.  `I got enough gear already.  Infrascan
perimeter, screamers...'
  `No,' he said, closing the door.  `I want it tight.'
  `Suit yourself.'  She wore a dark mesh t-shirt tucked into
baggy black cotton pants.
  `You ever the heat, Mr.~ Armitage?' Case asked, from where
he sat, his back against a wall.
  Armitage was no taller than Case, but with his broad shoul-
ders and military posture he seemed to fill the doorway.  He
wore a somber Italian suit; in his right hand he held a briefcase
of soft black calf.  The Special Forces earring was gone.  The
handsome, inexpressive features offered the routine beauty of
the cosmetic boutiques, a conservative amalgam of the past
decade's leading media faces.  The pale glitter of his eyes
heightened the effect of a mask.  Case began to regret the ques-
tion.
  `Lots of Forces types wound up cops, I mean.  Or corporate
security,' Case added uncomfortably.  Molly handed him a
steaming mug of coffee.  `That number you had them do on
my pancreas, that's like a cop routine.'
  Armitage closed the door and crossed the room, to stand in
front of Case.  `You're a lucky boy, Case.  You should thank
me.'
  `Should I?'  Case blew noisily on his coffee.
  `You needed a new pancreas.  The one we bought for you
frees you from a dangerous dependency.'
  `Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.'
  `Good, because you have a new one.'
  `How's that?'  Case looked up from his coffee.  Armitage
was smiling.
  `You have fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of various
main arteries, Case.  They're dissolving.  Very slowly, but they
definitely are dissolving.  Each one contains a mycotoxin.  You're
already familiar with the effect of that mycotoxin.  It was the
one your former employers gave you in Memphis.'
  Case blinked up at the smiling mask.
  `You have time to do what I'm hiring you for, Case, but
that's all.  Do the job and I can inject you with an enzyme that
will dissolve the bond without opening the sacs.  Then you'll
need a blood change.  Otherwise, the sacs melt and you're back
where I found you.  So you see, Case, you need us.  You need
us as badly as you did when we scraped you up from the gutter.'
  Case looked at Molly.  She shrugged.
  `Now go down to the freight elevator and bring up the cases
you find there.'  Armitage handed him the magnetic key.  `Go
on.  You'll enjoy this, Case.  Like Christmas morning.'

  Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like wind-
blown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies
of need and gratification.
  He sat beside Molly in filtered sunlight on the rim of a dry
concrete fountain, letting the endless stream of faces recapi-
tulate the stages of his life.  First a child with hooded eyes, a
street boy, hands relaxed and ready at his sides; then a teenager,
face smooth and cryptic beneath red glasses.  Case remembered
fighting on a rooftop at seventeen, silent combat in the rose
glow of the dawn geodesics.
  He shifted on the concrete, feeling it rough and cool through
the thin black denim.  Nothing here like the electric dance of
Ninsei.  This was different commerce, a different rhythm, in
the smell of fast food and perfume and fresh summer sweat.
  With his deck waiting, back in the loft, an Ono-Sendai
Cyberspace 7.  They'd left the place littered with the abstract
white forms of the foam packing units, with crumpled plastic
film and hundreds of tiny foam beads.  The Ono-Sendai; next
year's most expensive Hosaka computer; a Sony monitor; a
dozen disks of corporate-grade ice; a Braun coffeemaker.  Ar-
mitage had only waited for Case's approval of each piece.
  `Where'd he go?'  Case had asked Molly.
  `He likes hotels.  Big ones.  Near airports, if he can manage
it.  Let's go down to the street.'  She'd zipped herself into an
old surplus vest with a dozen oddly shaped pockets and put on
a huge pair of black plastic sunglasses that completely covered
her mirrored insets.
  `You know about that toxin shit, before?' he asked her, by
the fountain.  She shook her head.  `You think it's true?'
  `Maybe, maybe not.  Works either way.'
  `You know any way I can find out?'
  `No,' she said, her right hand coming up to form the jive
for silence.  `That kind of kink's too subtle to show up on a
scan.'  Then her fingers moved again: wait.  `And you don't
care that much anyway.  I saw you stroking that Sendai; man,
it was pornographic.'  She laughed.
  `So what's he got on you?  How's he got the working girl
kinked?'
  `Professional pride, baby, that's all.'  And again the sign
for silence.  `We're gonna get some breakfast, okay?  Eggs, real
bacon.  Probably kill you, you been eating that rebuilt Chiba
krill for so long.  Yeah, come on, we'll tube in to Manhattan
and get us a real breakfast.'

  Lifeless neon spelled out METRO HOLOGRAFIX in dusty
capitals of glass tubing.  Case picked at a shred of bacon that
had lodged between his front teeth.  He'd given up asking her
where they were going and why; jabs in the ribs and the sign
for silence were all he'd gotten in reply.  She talked about the
season's fashions, about sports, about a political scandal in
California he'd never heard of.
  He looked around the deserted dead end street.  A sheet of
newsprint went cartwheeling past the intersection.  Freak winds
in the East side; something to do with convection, and an
overlap in the domes.  Case peered through the window at the
dead sign.  Her Sprawl wasn't his Sprawl, he decided.  She'd
led him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before,
taking care of business, usually with no more than a nod. 
Maintaining connections.
  Something was moving in the shadows behind METRO
HOLOGRAFIX.
  The door was a sheet of corrugated roofing.  In front of it,
Molly's hands flowed through an intricate sequence of jive that
he couldn't follow.  He caught the sign for _cash,_ a thumb brush-
ing the tip of the forefinger.  The door swung inward and she
led him into the smell of dust.  They stood in a clearing, dense
tangles of junk rising on either side to walls lined with shelves
of crumbling paperbacks.  The junk looked like something that
had grown there, a fungus of twisted metal and plastic.  He
could pick out individual objects, but then they seemed to blur
back into the mass: the guts of a television so old it was studded
with the glass stumps of vacuum tubes, a crumpled dish an-
tenna, a brown fiber canister stuffed with corroded lengths of
alloy tubing.  An enormous pile of old magazines had cascaded
into the open area, flesh of lost summers staring blindly up as
he followed her back through a narrow canyon of impacted
scrap.  He heard the door close behind them.  He didn't look
back.
  The tunnel ended with an ancient Army blanket tacked across
a doorway.  White light flooded out as Molly ducked past it.
  Four square walls of blank white plastic, ceiling to match,
floored with white hospital tile molded in a nonslip pattern of
small raised disks.  In the center stood a square, white-painted
wooden table and four white folding chairs.
  The man who stood blinking now in the doorway behind
them, the blanket draping one shoulder like a cape, seemed to
have been designed in a wind tunnel.  His ears were very small,
plastered flat against his narrow skull, and his large front teeth,
revealed in something that wasn't quite a smile, were canted
sharply backward.  He wore an ancient tweed jacket and held
a handgun of some kind in his left hand.  He peered at them,
blinked, and dropped the gun into a jacket pocket.  He gestured
to Case, pointed at a slab of white plastic that leaned near the
doorway.  Case crossed to it and saw that it was a solid sandwich
of circuitry, nearly a centimeter thick.  He helped the man lift
it and position it in the doorway.  Quick, nicotine-stained fingers
secured it with a white velcro border.  A hidden exhaust fan
began to purr.
  `Time,' the man said, straightening up, `and counting.  You
know the rate, Moll.'
  `We need a scan, Finn.  For implants.'
  `So get over there between the pylons.  Stand on the tape. 
Straighten up, yeah.  Now turn around, gimme a full three-
sixty.'  Case watched her rotate between two fragile-looking
stands studded with sensors.  The man took a small monitor
from his pocket and squinted at it.  `Something new in your
head, yeah.  Silicon, coat of pyrolitic carbons.  A clock, right? 
Your glasses gimme the read they always have, low-temp is-
otropic carbons.  Better biocompatibility with pyrolitics, but
that's your business, right?  Same with your claws.'
  `Get over here, Case.'  He saw a scuffed X in black on the
white floor.  `Turn around.  Slow.'
  `Guy's a virgin.'  The man shrugged.  `Some cheap dental
work, is all.'
  `You read for biologicals?'  Molly unzipped her green vest
and took off the dark glasses.
  `You think this is the Mayo?  Climb on the table, kid, we'll
run a little biopsy.'  He laughed, showing more of his yellow
teeth.  `Nah.  Finn's word, sweetmeat, you got no little bugs,
no cortex bombs.  You want me to shut the screen down?'
  `Just for as long as it takes you to leave, Finn.  Then we'll
want full screen for as long as we want it.'
  `Hey, that's fine by the Finn, Moll.  You're only paying by
the second.'
  They sealed the door behind him and Molly turned one of
the white chairs around and sat on it, chin resting on crossed
forearms.  `We talk now.  This is as private as I can afford.'
  `What about?'
  `What we're doing.'
  `What are we doing?'
  `Working for Armitage.'
  `And you're saying this isn't for his benefit?'
  `Yeah.  I saw your profile, Case.  And I've seen the rest of
our shopping list, once.  You ever work with the dead?'
  `No.'  He watched his reflection in her glasses.  `I could.  I
guess.  I'm good at what I do.'  The present tense made him
nervous.
  `You know that the Dixie Flatline's dead?'
  He nodded.  `Heart, I heard.'
  `You'll be working with his construct.'  She smiled.  `Taught
you the ropes, huh?  Him and Quine.  I know Quine, by the
way.  Real asshole.'
  `Somebody's got a recording of McCoy Pauley?  Who?' 
Now Case sat, and rested his elbows on the table.  `I can't see
it.  He'd never have sat still for it.'
  `Sense/Net.  Paid him mega, you bet your ass.'
  `Quine dead too?'
  `No such luck.  He's in Europe.  He doesn't come into this.'
  `Well, if we can get the Flatline, we're home free.  He was
the best.  You know he died braindeath three times?'
  She nodded.
  `Flatlined on his EEG.  Showed me tapes.  Boy, I was _daid.'_
  `Look, Case, I been trying to suss out who it is is backing
Armitage since I signed on.  But it doesn't feel like a zaibatsu,
a government, or some Yakuza subsidiary.  Armitage gets or-
ders.  Like something tells him to go off to Chiba, pick up a
pillhead who's making one last wobble through the burnout
belt, and trade a program for the operation that'll fix him up. 
We coulda bought twenty world class cowboys for what the
market was ready to pay for that surgical program.  You were
good, but not _that_ good...'  She scratched the side of her
nose.
  `Obviously makes sense to somebody,' he said.  `Some-
body big.'
  `Don't let me hurt your feelings.'  She grinned.  `We're
gonna be pulling one hardcore run, Case, just to get the Flat-
line's construct.  Sense/Net has it locked in a library vault up-
town.  Tighter than an eel's ass, Case.  Now, Sense/Net, they
got all their new material for the fall season locked in there
too.  Steal that and we'd be richer than shit.  But no, we gotta
get us the Flatline and nothing else.  Weird.'
  `Yeah, it's all weird.  You're weird, this hole's weird, and
who's the weird little gopher outside in the hall?'
  `Finn's an old connection of mine.  Fence, mostly.  Software. 
This privacy biz is a sideline.  But I got Armitage to let him
be our tech here, so when he shows up later, you never saw
him.  Got it?'
  `So what's Armitage got dissolving inside you?'
  `I'm an easy make.'  She smiled.  `Anybody any good at
what they do, that's what they _are,_ right?  You gotta jack, I
gotta tussle.'
  He stared at her.  `So tell me what you know about Armi-
tage.'
  `For starters, nobody named Armitage took part in any
Screaming Fist.  I checked.  But that doesn't mean much.  He
doesn't look like any of the pics of the guys who got out.'  She
shrugged.  `Big deal.  And starters is all I got.'  She drummed
her nails on the back of the chair.  `But you _are_ a cowboy,
aren't you?  I mean, maybe you could have a little look around.' 
She smiled.
  `He'd kill me.'
  `Maybe.  Maybe not.  I think he needs you, Case, and real
bad.  Besides, you're a clever john, no?  You can winkle him,
sure.'
  `What else is on that list you mentioned?'
  `Toys.  Mostly for you.  And one certified psychopath name
of Peter Riviera.  Real ugly customer.'
  `Where's he?'
  `Dunno.  But he's one sick fuck, no lie.  I saw his profile.' 
She made a face.  `Godawful.'  She stood up and stretched,
catlike.  `So we got an axis going, boy?  We're together in this? 
Partners?'
  Case looked at her.  `I gotta lotta choice, huh?'
  She laughed.  `You got it, cowboy.'


  `The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games,' said
the voice-over, `in early graphics programs and military ex-
perimentation with cranial jacks.'  On the Sony, a two-dimen-
sional space war faded behind a forest of mathematically
generated ferns, demonstrating the spacial possibilities of log-
arithmic spirals; cold blue military footage burned through, lab
animals wired into test systems, helmets feeding into fire con-
trol circuits of tanks and war planes.  `Cyberspace.  A consen-
sual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate
operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathe-
matical concepts...  A graphic representation of data abstracted
from the banks of every computer in the human system.  Un-
thinkable complexity.  Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of
the mind, clusters and constellations of data.  Like city lights,
receding...'
  `What's that?' Molly asked, as he flipped the channel se-
lector.
  `Kid's show.'  A discontinuous flood of images as the se-
lector cycled.  `Off,' he said to the Hosaka.
  `You want to try now, Case?'
  Wednesday.  Eight days from waking in Cheap Hotel with
Molly beside him.  `You want me to go out, Case?  Maybe
easier for you, alone...'  He shook his head.
  `No.  Stay, doesn't matter.'  He settled the black terry sweat-
band across his forehead, careful not to disturb the flat Sendai
dermatrodes.  He stared at the deck on his lap, not really seeing
it, seeing instead the shop window on Ninsei, the chromed
shuriken burning with reflected neon.  He glanced up; on the
wall, just above the Sony, he'd hung her gift, tacking it there
with a yellow-headed drawing pin through the hole at its center.
  He closed his eyes.
  Found the ridged face of the power stud.
  And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes
boiling in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking
past like film compiled from random frames.  Symbols, figures,
faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information.
  Please, he prayed, _now --_
  A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.
  _Now --_
  Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler
gray.  Expanding --
  And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the
unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent
3D chessboard extending to infinity.  Inner eye opening to the
stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Au-
thority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of
America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms
of military systems, forever beyond his reach.
  And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft,
distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his
face.

  Molly was gone when he took the trodes off, and the loft
was dark.  He checked the time.  He'd been in cyberspace for
five hours.  He carried the Ono-Sendai to one of the new work-
tables and collapsed across the bedslab, pulling Molly's black
silk sleeping bag over his head.
  The security package taped to the steel firedoor bleeped
twice.  `Entry requested,' it said.  `Subject is cleared per my
program.'
  `So open it.'  Case pulled the silk from his face and sat up
as the door opened, expecting to see Molly or Armitage.
  `Christ,' said a hoarse voice, `I know that bitch can see in
the dark...'  A squat figure stepped in and closed the door. 
`Turn the lights on, okay?'  Case scrambled off the slab and
found the old-fashioned switch.
  `I'm the Finn,' said the Finn, and made a warning face at
Case.
  `Case.'
  `Pleased to meecha, I'm sure.  I'm doing some hardware
for your boss, it looks like.'  The Finn fished a pack of Partagas
from a pocket and lit one.  The smell of Cuban tobacco filled
the room.  He crossed to the worktable and glanced at the Ono- 
Sendai.  `Looks stock.  Soon fix that.  But here's your problem,
kid.'  He took a filthy manila envelope from inside his jacket,
flicked ash on the floor, and extracted a featureless black rec-
tangle from the envelope.  `Goddamn factory prototypes,' he
said, tossing the thing down on the table.  `Cast 'em into a
block of polycarbon, can't get in with a laser without frying
the works.  Booby-trapped for x-ray, ultrascan, God knows
what else.  We'll get in, but there's no rest for the wicked,
right?'  He folded the envelope with great care and tucked it
away in an inside pocket.
  `What is it?'
  `It's a flipflop switch, basically.  Wire it into your Sendai
here, you can access live or recorded simstim without having
to jack out of the matrix.'
  `What for?'
  `I haven't got a clue.  Know I'm fitting Moll for a broadcast
rig, though, so it's probably her sensorium you'll access.'  The
Finn scratched his chin.  `So now you get to find out just how
tight those jeans really are, huh?'



        4

  Case sat in the loft with the dermatrodes strapped across his
forehead, watching motes dance in the diluted sunlight that
filtered through the grid overhead.  A countdown was in pro-
gress in one corner of the monitor screen.
  Cowboys didn't get into simstim, he thought, because it
was basically a meat toy.  He knew that the trodes he used and
the little plastic tiara dangling from a simstim deck were bas-
ically the same, and that the cyberspace matrix was actually a
drastic simplification of the human sensorium, at least in terms
of presentation, but simstim itself struck him as a gratuitous
multiplication of flesh input.  The commercial stuff was edited,
of course, so that if Tally Isham got a headache in the course
of a segment, you didn't feel it.
  The screen bleeped a two-second warning.
  The new switch was patched into his Sendai with a thin
ribbon of fiberoptics.
  And one and two and --
  Cyberspace slid into existence from the cardinal points. 
Smooth, he thought, but not smooth enough.  Have to work on
it...
  Then he keyed the new switch.
  The abrupt jolt into other flesh.  Matrix gone, a wave of
sound and color...  She was moving through a crowded street,
past stalls vending discount software, prices feltpenned on sheets
of plastic, fragments of music from countless speakers.  Smells
of urine, free monomers, perfume, patties of frying krill.  For
a few frightened seconds he fought helplessly to control her
body.  Then he willed himself into passivity, became the pas-
senger behind her eyes.
  The glasses didn't seem to cut down the sunlight al all.  He
wondered if the built-in amps compensated automatically.  Blue
alphanumerics winked the time, low in her left peripheral field. 
Showing off, he thought.
  Her body language was disorienting, her style foreign.  She
seemed continually on the verge of colliding with someone,
but people melted out of her way, stepped sideways, made
room.
  `How you doing.  Case?'  He heard the words and felt her
form them.  She slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling
a nipple under warm silk.  The sensation made him catch his
breath.  She laughed.  But the link was one-way.  He had no way
to reply.
  Two blocks later, she was threading the outskirts of Memory
Lane.  Case kept trying to jerk her eyes toward landmarks he
would have used to find his way.  He began to find the passivity
of the situation irritating.
  The transition to cyberspace, when he hit the switch, was
instantaneous.  He punched himself down a wall of primitive
ice belonging to the New York Public Library automatically
counting potential windows.  Keying back into her sensorium,
into the sinuous flow of muscle, senses sharp and bright.
  He found himself wondering about the mind he shared these
sensations with.  What did he know about her?  That she was
another professional; that she said her being, like his, was the
thing she did to make a living.  He knew the way she'd moved
against him, earlier, when she woke, their mutual grunt of
unity when he'd entered her, and that she liked her coffee black,
afterward...
  Her destination was one of the dubious software rental com-
plexes that lined Memory Lane.  There was a stillness, a hush. 
Booths lined a central hall.  The clientele were young, few of
them out of their teens.  They all seemed to have carbon sockets
planted behind the left ear, but she didn't focus on them.  The
counters that fronted the booths displayed hundreds of slivers
of microsoft, angular fragments of colored silicon mounted
under oblong transparent bubbles on squares of white card-
board.  Molly went to the seventh booth along the south wall. 
Behind the counter a boy with a shaven head stared vacantly
into space, a dozen spikes of microsoft protruding from the
socket behind his ear.
  `Larry, you in, man?'  She positioned herself in front of
him.  The boy's eyes focused.  He sat up in his chair and pried
a bright magenta splinter from his socket with a dirty thumbnail.
  `Hey, Larry.'
  `Molly.'  He nodded.
  `I have some work for some of your friends, Larry.'
  Larry took a flat plastic case from the pocket of his red
sportshirt and flicked it open, slotting the microsoft beside a
dozen others.  His hand hovered, selected a glossy black chip
that was slightly longer than the rest, and inserted it smoothly
into his head.  His eyes narrowed.
  `Molly's got a rider,' he said, `and Larry doesn't like that.'
  `Hey,' she said, `I didn't know you were so... sensitive. 
I'm impressed.  Costs a lot, to get that sensitive.'
  `I know you, lady?'  The blank look returned.  `You looking
to buy some softs?'
  `I'm looking for the Moderns.'
  `You got a rider, Molly.  This says.'  He tapped the black
splinter.  `Somebody else using your eyes.'
  `My partner.'
  `Tell your partner to go.'
  `Got something for the Panther Moderns, Larry.'
  `What are you talking about, lady?'
  `Case, you take off,' she said, and he hit the switch, in-
stantly back in the matrix.  Ghost impressions of the software
complex hung for a few seconds in the buzzing calm of cy-
berspace.
  `Panther Moderns,' he said to the Hosaka, removing the
trodes.  `Five minute precis.'
  `Ready,' the computer said.
  It wasn't a name he knew.  Something new, something that
had come in since he'd been in Chiba.  Fads swept the youth
of the Sprawl at the speed of light: entire subcultures could rise
overnight, thrive for a dozen weeks, and then vanish utterly. 
`Go,' he said.  The Hosaka had accessed its array of libraries,
journals, and news services.
  The precis began with a long hold on a color still that Case
at first assumed was a collage of some kind, a boy's face
snipped from another image and glued to a photograph of a
paint-scrawled wall.  Dark eyes, epicanthic folds obviously the
result of surgery, an angry dusting of acne across pale narrow
cheeks.  The Hosaka released the freeze; the boy moved, flow-
ing with the sinister grace of a mime pretending to be a jungle
predator.  His body was nearly invisible, an abstract pattern
approximating the scribbled brickwork sliding smoothly across
his tight onepiece.  Mimetic polycarbon.
  Cut to Dr.~ Virginia Rambali, Sociology, NYU, her name,
faculty, and school pulsing across the screen in pink alphanu-
merics.
  `Given their penchant for these random acts of surreal vi-
olence,' someone said, `it may be difficult for our viewers to
understand why you continue to insist that this phenomenon
isn't a form of terrorism.'
  Dr.~ Rambali smiled.  `There is always a point at which the
terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt.  A point at
which the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the
terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself. 
Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is inately media-re-
lated.  The Panther Moderns differ from other terrorists pre-
cisely in their degree of self-consciousness, in their awareness
of the extent to which media divorce the act of terrorism from
the original sociopolitical intent...'
  `Skip it,' Case said.

  Case met his first Modern two days after he'd screened the
Hosaka's precis.  The Moderns, he'd decided, were a contem-
porary version of the Big Scientists of his own late teens.  There
was a kind of ghostly teenage DNA at work in the Sprawl,
something that carried the coded precepts of various short-lived
subcults and replicated them at odd intervals.  The Panther Mod-
erns were a softhead variant on the Scientists.  If the technology
had been available, the Big Scientists would all have had sock-
ets stuffed with microsofts.  It was the style that mattered and
the style was the same.  The Moderns were mercenaries, prac-
tical jokers, nihilistic technofetishists.
  The one who showed up at the loft door with a box of
diskettes from the Finn was a soft-voiced boy called Angelo. 
His face was a simple graft grown on collagen and shark- 
cartilage polysaccharides, smooth and hideous.  It was one of
the nastiest pieces of elective surgery Case had ever seen.  When
Angelo smiled, revealing the razor-sharp canines of some large
animal, Case was actually relieved.  Toothbud transplants.  He'd
seen that before.
  `You can't let the little pricks generation-gap you,' Molly
said.  Case nodded, absorbed in the patterns of the Sense/Net
ice.
  This was it.  This was what he was, who he was, his being. 
He forgot to eat.  Molly left cartons of rice and foam trays of
sushi on the corner of the long table.  Sometimes he resented
having to leave the deck to use the chemical toilet they'd set
up in a corner of the loft.  Ice patterns formed and reformed on
the screen as he probed for gaps, skirted the most obvious
traps, and mapped the route he'd take through Sense/Net's ice. 
It was good ice.  Wonderful ice.  Its patterns burned there while
he lay with his arm under Molly's shoulders, watching the red
dawn through the steel grid of the skylight.  Its rainbow pixel
maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He'd go straight
to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting
it.  He was working.  He lost track of days.
  And sometimes, falling asleep, particularly when Molly was
off on one of her reconnaissance trips with her rented cadre of
Moderns, images of Chiba came flooding back.  Faces and
Ninsei neon.  Once he woke from a confused dream of Linda
Lee, unable to recall who she was or what she'd ever meant
to him.  When he did remember, he jacked in and worked for
nine straight hours.
  The cutting of Sense/Net's ice took a total of nine days.
  `I said a week,' Armitage said, unable to conceal his sat-
isfaction when Case showed him his plan for the run.  `You
took your own good time.'
  `Balls,' Case said, smiling at the screen.  `That's good work,
Armitage.'
  `Yes,' Armitage admitted, `but don't let it go to your head. 
Compared to what you'll eventually be up against, this is an
arcade toy.'

  `Love you, Cat Mother,' whispered the Panther Modern's
link man.  His voice was modulated static in Case's headset. 
`Atlanta, Brood.  Looks go.  Go, got it?'  Molly's voice was
slightly clearer.
  `To hear is to obey.'  The Moderns were using some kind
of chickenwire dish in New Jersey to bounce the link man's
scrambled signal off a Sons of Christ the King satellite in
geosynchronous orbit above Manhattan.  They chose to regard
the entire operation as an elaborate private joke, and their
choice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate.  Molly's
signals were being beamed up from a one-meter umbrella dish
epoxy-ed to the roof of a black glass bank tower nearly as tall
as the Sense/Net building.
  Atlanta.  The recognition code was simple.  Atlanta to Boston
to Chicago to Denver, five minutes for each city.  If anyone
managed to intercept Molly's signal, unscramble it, synth her
voice, the code would tip the Moderns.  If she remained in the
building for more than twenty minutes, it was highly unlikely
she'd be coming out at all.
  Case gulped the last of his coffee, settled the trodes in place,
and scratched his chest beneath his black t-shirt.  He had only
a vague idea of what the Panther Moderns planned as a diver-
sion for the Sense/Net security people.  His job was to make
sure the intrusion program he'd written would link with the
Sense/Net systems when Molly needed it to.  He watched the
countdown in the corner of the screen.  Two.  One.
  He jacked in and triggered his program.  `Mainline,' breathed
the link man, his voice the only sound as Case plunged through
the glowing strata of Sense/Net ice.  Good.  Check Molly.  He
hit the simstim and flipped into her sensorium.
  The scrambler blurred the visual input slightly.  She stood
before a wall of gold-flecked mirror in the building's vast white
lobby, chewing gum, apparently fascinated by her own reflec-
tion.  Aside from the huge pair of sunglasses concealing her
mirrored insets, she managed to look remarkably like she
belonged there, another tourist girl hoping for a glimpse of
Tally Isham.  She wore a pink plastic raincoat, a white mesh
top, loose white pants cut in a style that had been fashionable
in Tokyo the previous year.  She grinned vacantly and popped
her gum.  Case felt like laughing.  He could feel the micropore
tape across her ribcage, feel the flat little units under it: the
radio, the simstim unit, and the scrambler.  The throat mike,
glued to her neck, looked as much as possible like an analgesic
dermadisk.  Her hands, in the pockets of the pink coat, were
flexing systematically through a series of tension-release ex-
ercises.  It took him a few seconds to realize that the peculiar
sensation at the tips of her fingers was caused by the blades as
they were partially extruded, then retracted.
  He flipped back.  His program had reached the fifth gate. 
He watched as his icebreaker strobed and shifted in front of
him, only faintly aware of his hands playing across the deck,
making minor adjustments.  Translucent planes of color shuffled
like a trick deck.  Take a card, he thought, any card.
  The gate blurred past.  He laughed.  The Sense/Net ice had
accepted his entry as a routine transfer from the consortium's
Los Angeles complex.  He was inside.  Behind him, viral sub-
programs peeled off, meshing with the gate's code fabric, ready
to deflect the real Los Angeles data when it arrived.
  He flipped again.  Molly was strolling past the enormous
circular reception desk at the rear of the lobby.
  12:01:20 as the readout flared in her optic nerve.

  At midnight, synched with the chip behind Molly's eye, the
link man in Jersey had given his command.  `Mainline.'  Nine
Moderns, scattered along two hundred miles of the Sprawl,
had simultaneously dialed MAX EMERG from pay phones. 
Each Modern delivered a short set speech, hung up, and drifted
out into the night, peeling off surgical gloves.  Nine different
police departments and public security agencies were absorbing
the information that an obscure subsect of militant Christian
fundamentalists had just taken credit for having introduced
clinical levels of an outlawed psychoactive agent known as
Blue Nine into the ventilation system of the Sense/Net Pyramid. 
Blue Nine, known in California as Grievous Angel, had been
shown to produce acute paranoia and homicidal psychosis in
eighty-five percent of experimental subjects.

  Case hit the switch as his program surged through the gates
of the subsystem that controlled security for the Sense/Net
research library.  He found himself stepping into an elevator.
  `Excuse me, but are you an employee?'  The guard raised
his eyebrows.  Molly popped her gum.  `No,' she said, driving
the first two knuckles of her right hand into the man's solar
plexus.  As he doubled over, clawing for the beeper on his belt,
she slammed his head sideways, against the wall of the elevator.
  Chewing a little more rapidly now, she touched CLOSE
DOOR and STOP on the illuminated panel.  She took a blackbox
from her coat pocket and inserted a lead in the keyhole of the
lock that secured the panel's circuitry.

  The Panther Moderns allowed four minutes for their first
move to take effect, then injected a second carefully prepared
dose of misinformation.  This time, they shot it directly into
the Sense/Net building's internal video system.
  At 12:04:03, every screen in the building strobed for eigh-
teen seconds in a frequency that produced seizures in a sus-
ceptible segment of Sense/Net employees.  Then something only
vaguely like a human face filled the screens, its features stretched
across asymmetrical expanses of bone like some obscene Mer-
cator projection.  Blue lips parted wetly as the twisted, elongated
jaw moved.  Something, perhaps a hand, a thing like a reddish
clump of gnarled roots, fumbled toward the camera, blurred,
and vanished.  Subliminally rapid images of contamination:
graphics of the building's water supply system, gloved hands
manipulating laboratory glassware, something tumbling down
into darkness, a pale splash...  The audio track, its pitch ad-
justed to run at just less than twice the standard playback speed,
was part of a month-old newscast detailing potential military
uses of a substance known as HsG, a biochemical governing
the human skeletal growth factor.  Overdoses of HsG threw
certain bone cells into overdrive, accelerating growth by factors
as high as one thousand percent.
  At 12:05:00, the mirror-sheathed nexus of the Sense/Net
consortium held just over three thousand employees.  At five
minutes after midnight, as the Moderns'~ message ended in a
flare of white screen, the Sense/Net Pyramid screamed.
  Half a dozen NYPD Tactical hovercraft, responding to the
possibility of Blue Nine in the building's ventilation system,
were converging on the Sense/Net Pyramid.  They were running
full riot lights.  A BAMA Rapid Deployment helicopter was
lifting off from its pad on Riker's.

  Case triggered his second program.  A carefully engineered
virus attacked the code fabric screening primary custodial com-
mands for the sub-basement that housed the Sense/Net research
materials.  `Boston,' Molly's voice came across the link, `I'm
downstairs.'  Case switched and saw the blank wall of the
elevator.  She was unzipping the white pants.  A bulky packet,
exactly the shade of her pale ankle, was secured there with
micropore.  She knelt and peeled the tape away.  Streaks of
burgundy flickered across the mimetic polycarbon as she un-
folded the Modern suit.  She removed the pink raincoat, threw
it down beside the white pants, and began to pull the suit on
over the white mesh top.
  12:06:26.
  Case's virus had bored a window through the library's com-
mand ice.  He punched himself through and found an infinite
blue space ranged with color-coded spheres strung on a tight
grid of pale blue neon.  In the nonspace of the matrix, the interior
of a given data construct possessed unlimited subjective di-
mension; a child's toy calculator, accessed through Case's Sen-
dai, would have presented limitless gulfs of nothingness hung
with a few basic commands.  Case began to key the sequence
the Finn had purchased from a mid-eschelon sarariman with
severe drug problems.  He began to glide through the spheres
as if he were on invisible tracks.
  Here.  This one.
  Punching his way into the sphere, chill blue neon vault above
him starless and smooth as frosted glass, he triggered a sub-
program that effected certain alterations in the core custodial
commands.
  Out now.  Reversing smoothly, the virus reknitting the fabric
of the window.
  Done.

  In the Sense/Net lobby, two Panther Moderns sat alertly
behind a low rectangular planter, taping the riot with a video
camera.  They both wore chameleon suits.  `Tacticals are spray-
ing foam barricades now,' one noted, speaking for the benefit
of his throat mike.  `Rapids are still trying to land their copter.'

  Case hit the simstim switch.  And flipped into the agony of
broken bone.  Molly was braced against the blank gray wall of
a long corridor, her breath coming ragged and uneven.  Case
was back in the matrix instantly, a white-hot line of pain fading
in his left thigh.
  `What's happening, Brood?' he asked the link man.
  `I dunno, Cutter.  Mother's not talking.  Wait.'
  Case's program was cycling.  A single hair-fine thread of
crimson neon extended from the center of the restored window
to the shifting outline of his icebreaker.  He didn't have time
to wait.  Taking a deep breath, he flipped again.
  Molly took a single step, trying to support her weight on
the corridor wall.  In the loft, Case groaned.  The second step
took her over an outstretched arm.  Uniform sleeve bright with
fresh blood.  Glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shockstave.  Her
vision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel.  With the third
step, Case screamed and found himself back in the matrix.
  `Brood?  Boston, baby...'  Her voice tight with pain.  She
coughed.  `Little problem with the natives.  Think one of them
broke my leg.'
  `What you need now, Cat Mother?'  The link man's voice
was indistinct, nearly lost behind static.
  Case forced himself to flip back.  She was leaning against
the wall, taking all of her weight on her right leg.  She fumbled
through the contents of the suit's kangaroo pocket and withdrew
a sheet of plastic studded with a rainbow of dermadisks.  She
selected three and thumbed them hard against her left wrist,
over the veins.  Six thousand micrograms of endorphin analog
came down on the pain like a hammer, shattering it.  Her back
arched convulsively.  Pink waves of warmth lapped up her thighs. 
She sighed and slowly relaxed.
  `Okay, Brood.  Okay now.  But I'll need a medical team
when I come out.  Tell my people.  Cutter, I'm two minutes
from target.  Can you hold?'
  `Tell her I'm in and holding,' Case said.
  Molly began to limp down the corridor.  When she glanced
back, once, Case saw the crumpled bodies of three Sense/Net
security guards.  One of them seemed to have no eyes.
  `Tacticals and Rapids have sealed the ground floor, Cat
Mother.  Foam barricades.  Lobby's getting juicy.'
  `Pretty juicy down here,' she said, swinging herself through
a pair of gray steel doors.  `Almost there, Cutter.'
  Case flipped into the matrix and pulled the trodes from his
forehead.  He was drenched with sweat.  He wiped his forehead
with a towel, took a quick sip of water from the bicycle bottle
beside the Hosaka, and checked the map of the library displayed
on the screen.  A pulsing red cursor crept through the outline
of a doorway.  Only millimeters from the green dot that indi-
cated the location of the Dixie Flatline's construct.  He won-
dered what it was doing to her leg, to walk on it that way. 
With enough endorphin analog, she could walk on a pair of
bloody stumps.  He tightened the nylon harness that held him
in the chair and replaced the trodes.
  Routine now: trodes, jack, and flip.
  The Sense/Net research library was a dead storage area; the
materials stored here had to be physically removed before they
could be interfaced.  Molly hobbled between rows of identical
gray lockers.
  `Tell her five more and ten to her left, Brood,' Case said.
  `Five more and ten left, Cat Mother,' the link man said.
  She took the left.  A white-faced librarian cowered between
two lockers, her cheeks wet, eyes blank.  Molly ignored her. 
Case wondered what the Moderns had done to provoke that
level of terror.  He knew it had something to do with a hoaxed
threat, but he'd been too involved with his ice to follow Molly's
explanation.
  `That's it,' Case said, but she'd already stopped in front of
the cabinet that held the construct.  Its lines reminded Case of
the Neo-Aztec bookcases in Julie Deane's anteroom in Chiba.
  `Do it, Cutter,' Molly said.
  Case flipped to cyberspace and sent a command pulsing
down the crimson thread that pierced the library ice.  Five sep-
arate alarm systems were convinced that they were still oper-
ative.  The three elaborate locks deactivated, but considered
themselves to have remained locked.  The library's central bank
suffered a minute shift in its permanent memory: the construct
had been removed, per executive order, a month before.  Check-
ing for the authorization to remove the construct, a librarian
would find the records erased.
  The door swung open on silent hinges.
  `0467839,' Case said, and Molly drew a black storage unit
from the rack.  It resembled the magazine of a large assault
rifle, its surfaces covered with warning decals and security
ratings.
  Molly closed the locker door; Case flipped.
  He withdrew the line through the library ice.  It whipped
back into his program, automatically triggering a full system
reversal.  The Sense/Net gates snapped past him as he backed
out, subprograms whirling back into the core of the icebreaker
as he passed the gates where they had been stationed.
  `Out, Brood,' he said, and slumped in his chair.  After the
concentration of an actual run, he could remain jacked in and
still retain awareness of his body.  It might take Sense/Net days
to discover the theft of the construct.  The key would be the
deflection of the Los Angeles transfer, which coincided too
neatly with the Modern's terror run.  He doubted that the three
security men Molly had encountered in the corridor would live
to talk about it.  He flipped.
  The elevator, with Molly's blackbox taped beside the control
panel, remained where she'd left it.  The guard still lay curled
on the floor.  Case noticed the derm on his neck for the first
time.  Something of Molly's, to keep him under.  She stepped
over him and removed the blackbox before punching LOBBY.
  As the elevator door hissed open, a woman hurtled backward
out of the crowd, into the elevator, and struck the rear wall
with her head.  Molly ignored her, bending over to peel the
derm from the guard's neck.  Then she kicked the white pants
and the pink raincoat out the door, tossing the dark glasses
after them, and drew the hood of her suit down across her
forehead.  The construct, in the suit's kangaroo pocket, dug
into her sternum when she moved.  She stepped out.
  Case had seen panic before, but never in an enclosed area.
  The Sense/Net employees, spilling out of the elevators, had
surged for the street doors, only to meet the foam barricades
of the Tacticals and the sandbag-guns of the BAMA Rapids. 
The two agencies, convinced that they were containing a horde
of potential killers, were cooperating with an uncharacteristic
degree of efficiency.  Beyond the shattered wreckage of the
main street doors, bodies were piled three deep on the barri-
cades.  The hollow thumping of the riot guns provided a constant
background for the sound the crowd made as it surged back
and forth across the lobby's marble floor.  Case had never heard
anything like that sound.
  Neither, apparently, had Molly.  `Jesus,' she said, and hes-
itated.  It was a sort of keening, rising into a bubbling wail of
raw and total fear.  The lobby floor was covered with bodies,
clothing, blood, and long trampled scrolls of yellow printout.
  `C'mon, sister.  We're for out.'  The eyes of the two Moderns
stared out of madly swirling shades of polycarbon, their suits
unable to keep up with the confusion of shape and color that
raged behind them.  `You hurt?  C'mon.  Tommy'll walk you.' 
Tommy handed something to the one who spoke, a video cam-
era wrapped in polycarbon.
  `Chicago,' she said, `I'm on my way.'  And then she was
falling, not to the marble floor, slick with blood and vomit,
but down some bloodwarm well, into silence and the dark.

  The Panther Modern leader, who introduced himself as Lu-
pus Yonderboy, wore a polycarbon suit with a recording feature
that allowed him to replay backgrounds at will.  Perched on the
edge of Case's worktable like some kind of state of the art
gargoyle, he regarded Case and Armitage with hooded eyes. 
He smiled.  His hair was pink.  A rainbow forest of microsofts
bristled behind his left ear; the ear was pointed, tufted with
more pink hair.  His pupils had been modified to catch the light
like a cat's.  Case watched the suit crawl with color and texture.
  `You let it get out of control,' Armitage said.  He stood in
the center of the loft like a statue, wrapped in the dark glossy
folds of an expensive-looking trenchcoat.
  `Chaos, Mr.~ Who,' Lupus Yonderboy said.  `That is our
mode and modus.  That is our central kick.  Your woman knows. 
We deal with her.  Not with you, Mr.~ Who.'  His suit had taken
on a weird angular pattern of beige and pale avocado.  `She
needed her medical team.  She's with them.  We'll watch out
for her.  Everything's fine.'  He smiled again.
  `Pay him,' Case said.
  Armitage glared at him.  `We don't have the goods.'
  `Your woman has it,' Yonderboy said.
  `Pay him.'
  Armitage crossed stiffly to the table and took three fat bun-
dles of New Yen from the pockets of his trenchcoat.  `You
want to count it?' he asked Yonderboy.
  `No,' the Panther Modern said.  `You'll pay.  You're a Mr.~
Who.  You pay to stay one.  Not a Mr.~ Name.'
  `I hope that isn't a threat,' Armitage said.
  `That's business,' said Yonderboy, stuffing the money into
the single pocket on the front of his suit.
  The phone rang.  Case answered.
  `Molly,' he told Armitage, handing him the phone.

  The Sprawl's geodesics were lightening into predawn gray
as Case left the building.  His limbs felt cold and disconnected. 
He couldn't sleep.  He was sick of the loft.  Lupus had gone,
then Armitage, and Molly was in surgery somewhere.  Vibration
beneath his feet as a train hissed past.  Sirens dopplered in the
distance.
  He took corners at random, his collar up, hunched in a new
leather jacket, flicking the first of a chain of Yeheyuans into
the gutter and lighting another.  He tried to imagine Armitage's
toxin sacs dissolving in his bloodstream, microscopic mem-
branes wearing thinner as he walked, it didn't seem real.  Nei-
ther did the fear and agony he'd seen through Molly's eyes in
the lobby of Sense/Net.  He found himself trying to remember
the faces of the three people he'd killed in Chiba.  The men
were blanks; the woman reminded him of Linda Lee.  A battered
tricycle-truck with mirrored windows bounced past him, empty
plastic cylinders rattling in its bed.
  `Case.'
  He darted sideways, instinctively getting a wall behind his
back.
  `Message for you, Case.'  Lupus Yonderboy's suit cycled
through pure primaries.  `Pardon.  Not to startle you.'
  Case straightened up, hands in jacket pockets.  He was a
head taller than the Modern.  `You oughta be careful, Yon-
derboy.'
  `This is the message.  Wintermute.'  He spelled it out.
  `From you?'  Case took a step forward.
  `No,' Yonderboy said.  `For you.'
  `Who from?'
  `Wintermute,' Yonderboy repeated, nodding, bobbing his
crest of pink hair.  His suit went matte black, a carbon shadow
against old concrete.  He executed a strange little dance, his
thin black arms whirling, and then he was gone.  No.  There. 
Hood up to hide the pink, the suit exactly the right shade of
gray, mottled and stained as the sidewalk he stood on.  The
eyes winked back the red of a stoplight.  And then he was really
gone.
  Case closed his eyes, massaged them with numb fingers,
leaning back against peeling brickwork.
  Ninsei had been a lot simpler.



        5

  The medical team Molly employed occupied two floors of
an anonymous condo-rack near the old hub of Baltimore.  The
building was modular, like some giant version of Cheap Hotel,
each coffin forty meters long.  Case met Molly as she emerged
from one that wore the elaborately worked logo of one GER-
ALD CHIN, DENTIST.  She was limping.
  `He says if I kick anything, it'll fall off.'
  `I ran into one of your pals,' he said, `a Modern.'
  `Yeah?  Which one?'
  `Lupus Yonderboy.  Had a message.'  He passed her a paper
napkin with W I N T E R M U T E printed in red feltpen in
his neat, laborious capitals.  `He said --'  But her hand came
up in the jive for silence.
  `Get us some crab,' she said.

  After lunch in Baltimore, Molly dissecting her crab with
alarming ease, they tubed in to New York.  Case had learned
not to ask questions; they only brought the sign for silence. 
Her leg seemed to be bothering her, and she seldom spoke.
  A thin black child with wooden beads and antique resistors
woven tightly into her hair opened the Finn's door and led them
along the tunnel of refuse.  Case felt the stuff had grown some-
how during their absence.  Or else it seemed that it was changing
subtly, cooking itself down under the pressure of time, silent
invisible flakes settling to form a mulch, a crystalline essence
of discarded technology, flowering secretly in the Sprawl's
waste places.
  Beyond the army blanket, the Finn waited at the white table.
  Molly began to sign rapidly, produced a scrap of paper,
wrote something on it, and passed it to the Finn.  He took it
between thumb and forefinger, holding it away from his body
as though it might explode.  He made a sign Case didn't know,
one that conveyed a mixture of impatience and glum resigna-
tion.  He stood up, brushing crumbs from the front of his bat-
tered tweed jacket.  A glass jar of pickled herring stood on the
table beside a torn plastic package of flatbread and a tin ashtray
piled with the butts of Partagas.
  `Wait,' the Finn said, and left the room.
  Molly took his place, extruded the blade from her index
finger, and speared a grayish slab of herring.  Case wandered
aimlessly around the room, fingering the scanning gear on the
pylons as he passed.
  Ten minutes and the Finn came bustling back, showing his
teeth in a wide yellow smile.  He nodded, gave Molly a thumbs- 
up salute, and gestured to Case to help him with the door panel. 
While Case smoothed the velcro border into place, the Finn
took a flat little console from his pocket and punched out an
elaborate sequence.
  `Honey,' he said to Molly, tucking the console away, `you
have got it.  No shit, I can smell it.  You wanna tell me where
you got it?'
  `Yonderboy,' Molly said, shoving the herring and crackers
aside.  `I did a deal with Larry, on the side.'
  `Smart,' the Finn said.  `It's an AI.'
  `Slow it down a little,' Case said.
  `Berne,' the Finn said, ignoring him.  `Berne.  It's got lim-
ited Swiss citizenship under their equivalent of the Act of '53. 
Built for Tessier-Ashpool S.A.  They own the mainframe and
the original software.'
  `What's in Berne, okay?'  Case deliberately stepped between
them.
  `Wintermute is the recognition code for an AI.  I've got the
Turing Registry numbers.  Artificial intelligence.'
  `That's all just fine,' Molly said, `but where's it get us?'
  `If Yonderboy's right,' the Finn said, `this AI is backing
Armitage.'
  `I paid Larry to have the Moderns nose around Armitage a
little,' Molly explained, turning to Case.  `They have some
very weird lines of communication.  Deal was, they'd get my
money if they answered one question: who's running Armi-
tage?'
  `And you think it's this AI?  Those things aren't allowed
any autonomy.  It'll be the parent corporation, this Tessle...'
  `Tessier-Ashpool S.A.,' said the Finn.  `And I got a little
story for you about them.  Wanna hear?'  He sat down and
hunched forward.
  `Finn,' Molly said.  `He loves a story.'
  `Haven't ever told anybody this one,' the Finn began.

  The Finn was a fence, a trafficker in stolen goods, primarily
in software.  In the course of his business, he sometimes came
into contact with other fences, some of whom dealt in the more
traditional articles of the trade.  In precious metals, stamps, rare
coins, gems, jewelry, furs, and paintings and other works of
art.  The story he told Case and Molly began with another man's
story, a man he called Smith.
  Smith was also a fence, but in balmier seasons he surfaced
as an art dealer.  He was the first person the Finn had known
who'd `gone silicon' -- the phrase had an old-fashioned ring
for Case -- and the microsofts he purchased were art history
programs and tables of gallery sales.  With half a dozen chips
in his new socket, Smith's knowledge of the art business was
formidable, at least by the standards of his colleagues.  But
Smith had come to the Finn with a request for help, a fraternal
request, one businessman to another.  He wanted a go-to on the
Tessier-Ashpool clan, he said, and it had to be executed in a
way that would guarantee the impossibility of the subject ever
tracing the inquiry to its source.  It might be possible, the Finn
had opined, but an explanation was definitely required.  `It
smelled,' the Finn said to Case, `smelled of money.  And Smith
was being very careful.  Almost too careful.'
  Smith, it developed, had had a supplier known as Jimmy. 
Jimmy was a burglar and other things as well, and just back
from a year in high orbit, having carried certain things back
down the gravity well.  The most unusual thing Jimmy had
managed to score on his swing through the archipelago was a
head, an intricately worked bust, cloisonn over platinum, stud-
ded with seedpearls and lapis.  Smith, sighing, had put down
his pocket microscope and advised Jimmy to melt the thing
down.  It was contemporary, not an antique, and had no value
to the collector.  Jimmy laughed.  The thing was a computer
terminal, he said.  It could talk.  And not in a synth-voice, but
with a beautiful arrangement of gears and miniature organ pipes. 
It was a baroque thing for anyone to have constructed, a per-
verse thing, because synth-voice chips cost next to nothing.  It
was a curiosity.  Smith jacked the head into his computer and
listened as the melodious, inhuman voice piped the figures of
last year's tax return.
  Smith's clientele included a Tokyo billionaire whose passion
for clockwork automata approached fetishism.  Smith shrugged,
showing Jimmy his upturned palms in a gesture old as pawn
shops.  He could try, he said, but he doubted he could get much
for it.
  When Jimmy had gone, leaving the head, Smith went over
it carefully, discovering certain hallmarks.  Eventually he'd been
able to trace it to an unlikely collaboration between two Zurich
artisans, an enamel specialist in Paris, a Dutch jeweler, and a
California chip designer.  It had been commissioned, he dis-
covered, by Tessier-Ashpool S.A.
  Smith began to make preliminary passes at the Tokyo col-
lector, hinting that he was on the track of something notewor-
thy.
  And then he had a visitor, a visitor unannounced, one who
walked in through the elaborate maze of Smith's security as
though it didn't exist.  A small man, Japanese, enormously
polite, who bore all the marks of a vatgrown ninja assassin. 
Smith sat very still, staring into the calm brown eyes of death
across a polished table of Vietnamese rosewood.  Gently, almost
apologetically, the cloned killer explained that it was his duty
to find and return a certain artwork, a mechanism of great
beauty, which had been taken from the house of his master.  It
had come to his attention, the ninja said, that Smith might
know of the whereabouts of this object.
  Smith told the man that he had no wish to die, and produced
the head.  And how much, his visitor asked, did you expect to
obtain through the sale of this object?  Smith named a figure
far lower than the price he'd intended to set.  The ninja produced
a credit chip and keyed Smith that amount out of a numbered
Swiss account.  And who, the man asked, brought you this
piece?  Smith told him.  Within days, Smith learned of Jimmy's
death.
  `So that was where I came in,' the Finn continued.  `Smith
knew I dealt a lot with the Memory Lane crowd, and that's
where you go for a quiet go-to that'll never be traced.  I hired
a cowboy.  I was the cut-out, so I took a percentage.  Smith,
he was careful.  He'd just had a very weird business experience
and he'd come out on top, but it didn't add up.  Who'd paid,
out of that Swiss stash?  Yakuza?  No way.  They got a very
rigid code covers situations like that, and they kill the receiver
too, always.  Was it spook stuff?  Smith didn't think so.  Spook
biz has a vibe, you get so you can smell it.  Well, I had my
cowboy buzz the news morgues until we found Tessier-Ashpool
in litigation.  The case wasn't anything, but we got the law
firm.  Then he did the lawyer's ice and we got the family
address.  Lotta good it did us.'
  Case raised his eyebrows.
  `Freeside,' the Finn said.  `The spindle.  Turns out they own
damn near the whole thing.  The interesting stuff was the picture
we got when the cowboy ran a regular go-to on the news
morgues and compiled a precis.  Family organization.  Corporate
structure.  Supposedly you can buy into an S.A., but there hasn't
been a share of Tessier-Ashpool traded on the open market in
over a hundred years.  On any market, as far as I know.  You're
looking at a very quiet, very eccentric first-generation high- 
orbit family, run like a corporation.  Big money, very shy of
media.  Lot of cloning.  Orbital law's a lot softer on genetic
engineering, right?  And it's hard to keep track of which gen-
eration, or combination of generations, is running the show at
a given time.'
  `How's that?' Molly asked.
  `Got their own cryogenic setup.  Even under orbital law,
you're legally dead for the duration of a freeze.  Looks like
they trade off, though nobody's seen the founding father in
about thirty years.  Founding momma, she died in some lab
accident...'
  `So what happened with your fence?'
  `Nothing.'  The Finn frowned.  `Dropped it.  We had a look
at this fantastic tangle of powers of attorney the T-A's have,
and that was it.  Jimmy must've gotten into Straylight, lifted
the head, and Tessier-Ashpool sent their ninja after it.  Smith
decided to forget about it.  Maybe he was smart.'  He looked
at Molly.  `The Villa Straylight.  Tip of the spindle.  Strictly
private.'
  `You figure they own that ninja, Finn?' Molly asked.
  `Smith thought so.'
  `Expensive,' she said.  `Wonder whatever happened to that
little ninja, Finn?'
  `Probably got him on ice.  Thaw when needed.'
  `Okay,' Case said, `we got Armitage getting his goodies
off an AI named Wintermute.  Where's that get us?'
  `Nowhere yet,' Molly said, `but you got a little side gig
now.'  She drew a folded scrap of paper from her pocket and
handed it to him.  He opened it.  Grid coordinates and entry
codes.
  `Who's this?'
  `Armitage.  Some data base of his.  Bought it from the Mod-
erns.  Separate deal.  Where is it?'
  `London,' Case said.
  `Crack it.'  She laughed.  `Earn your keep for a change.'

  Case waited for a trans-BAMA local on the crowded plat-
form.  Molly had gone back to the loft hours ago, the Flatline's
construct in her green bag, and Case had been drinking steadily
ever since.
  It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a
hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man's skills, ob-
sessions, kneejerk responses...  The local came booming in
along the black induction strip, fine grit sifting from cracks in
the tunnel's ceiling.  Case shuffled into the nearest door and
watched the other passengers as he rode.  A pair of predatory- 
looking Christian Scientists were edging toward a trio of young
office techs who wore idealized holographic vaginas on their
wrists, wet pink glittering under the harsh lighting.  The techs
licked their perfect lips nervously and eyed the Christian Sci-
entists from beneath lowered metallic lids.  The girls looked
like tall, exotic grazing animals, swaying gracefully and un-
consciously with the movement of the train, their high heels
like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car's floor. 
Before they could stampede, take flight from the missionaries,
the train reached Case's station.
  He stepped out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar
suspended against the wall of the station, FREESIDE pulsing
beneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed Japanese. 
He walked through the crowd and stood beneath it, studying
the thing.  WHY WAIT? pulsed the sign.  A blunt white spindle,
flanged and studded with grids and radiators, docks, domes. 
He'd seen the ad, or others like it, thousands of times.  It had
never appealed to him.  With his deck, he could reach the
Freeside banks as easily as he could reach Atlanta.  Travel was
a meat thing.  But now he noticed the little sigil, the size of a
small coin, woven into the lower left corner of the ad's fabric
of light: T-A.
  He walked back to the loft, lost in memories of the Flatline. 
He'd spent most of his nineteenth summer in the Gentleman
Loser, nursing expensive beers and watching the cowboys. 
He'd never touched a deck, then, but he knew what he wanted. 
There were at least twenty other hopefuls ghosting the Loser,
that summer, each one bent on working joeboy for some cow-
boy.  No other way to learn.
  They'd all heard of Pauley, the redneck jockey from the
'Lanta fringes, who'd survived braindeath behind black ice. 
The grapevine -- slender, street level, and the only one going --
had little to say about Pauley, other than that he'd done the
impossible.  `It was big,' another would-be told Case, for the
price of a beer, `but who knows what?  I hear maybe a Brazilian
payroll net.  Anyway, the man was dead, flat down braindeath.' 
Case stared across the crowded bar at a thickset man in shirt-
sleeves, something leaden about the shade of his skin.
  `Boy,' the Flatline would tell him, months later in Miami,
`I'm like them huge fuckin'~ lizards, you know?  Had themself
two goddam brains, one in the head an'~ one by the tailbone,
kept the hind legs movin'~.  Hit that black stuff and ol'~ tailbrain
jus'~ kept right on keepin'~ on.'
  The cowboy elite in the Loser shunned Pauley out of some
strange group anxiety, almost a superstition.  McCoy Pauley,
Lazarus of cyberspace...
  And his heart had done for him in the end.  His surplus
Russian heart, implanted in a POW camp during the war.  He'd
refused to replace the thing, saying he needed its particular
beat to maintain his sense of timing.  Case fingered the slip of
paper Molly had given him and made his way up the stairs.
  Molly was snoring on the temperfoam.  A transparent cast
ran from her knee to a few millimeters below her crotch, the
skin beneath the rigid micropore mottled with bruises, the black
shading into ugly yellow.  Eight derms, each a different size
and color, ran in a neat line down her left wrist.  An Akai
transdermal unit lay beside her, its fine red leads connected to
input trodes under the cast.
  He turned on the tensor beside the Hosaka.  The crisp circle
of light fell directly on the Flatline's construct.  He slotted some
ice, connected the construct, and jacked in.
  It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his
shoulder.
  He coughed.  `Dix?  McCoy?  That you man?'  His throat was
tight.
  `Hey, bro,' said a directionless voice.
  `It's Case, man.  Remember?'
  `Miami, joeboy, quick study.'
  `What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you,
Dix?'
  `Nothin'~.'
  `Hang on.'  He disconnected the construct.  The presence
was gone.  He reconnected it.  `Dix?  Who am I?'
  `You got me hung, Jack.  Who the fuck are you?'
  `Ca -- your buddy.  Partner.  What's happening, man?'
  `Good question.'
  `Remember being here, a second ago?'
  `No.'
  `Know how a ROM personality matrix works?'
  `Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct.'
  `So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential,
real time memory?'
  `Guess so,' said the construct.
  `Okay, Dix.  You _are_ a ROM construct.  Got me?'
  `If you say so,' said the construct.  `Who are you?'
  `Case.'
  `Miami,' said the voice, `joeboy, quick study.'
  `Right.  And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze
over to London grid and access a little data.  You game for
that?'
  `You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?'



        6

  `You want you a paradise,' the Flatline advised, when Case
had explained his situation.  `Check Copenhagen, fringes of
the university section.'  The voice recited coordinates as he
punched.
  They found their paradise, a `pirate's paradise,' on the
jumbled border of a low-security academic grid.  At first glance
it resembled the kind of graffiti student operators sometimes
left at the junctions of grid lines, faint glyphs of colored light
that shimmered against the confused outlines of a dozen arts
faculties.
  `There,' said the Flatline, `the blue one.  Make it out?  That's
an entry code for Bell Europa.  Fresh, too.  Bell'll get in here
soon and read the whole damn board, change any codes they
find posted.  Kids'll steal the new ones tomorrow.'
  Case tapped his way into Bell Europa and switched to a
standard phone code.  With the Flatline's help, he connected
with the London data base that Molly claimed was Armitage's.
  `Here,' said the voice, `I'll do it for you.'  The Flatline
began to chant a series of digits, Case keying them on his deck,
trying to catch the pauses the construct used to indicate timing. 
It took three tries.
  `Big deal,' said the Flatline.  `No ice at all.'
  `Scan this shit,' Case told the Hosaka.  `Sift for owner's
personal history.'
  The neuroelectronic scrawls of the paradise vanished, re-
placed by a simple lozenge of white light.  `Contents are pri-
marily video recordings of postwar military trials,' said the
distant voice of the Hosaka.  `Central figure is Colonel Willis
Corto.'
  `Show it already,' Case said.
  A man's face filled the screen.  The eyes were Armitage's.

  Two hours later, Case fell beside Molly on the slab and let
the temperfoam mold itself against him.
  `You find anything?' she asked, her voice fuzzy with sleep
and drugs.
  `Tell you later,' he said, `I'm wrecked.'  He was hungover
and confused.  He lay there, eyes closed, and tried to sort the
various parts of a story about a man called Corto.  The Hosaka
had sorted a thin store of data and assembled a precis, but it
was full of gaps.  Some of the material had been print records,
reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and Case had
had to ask the computer to read them for him.  Other segments
were audio recordings of the Screaming Fist hearing.
  Willis Corto, Colonel, had plummeted through a blind spot
in the Russian defenses over Kirensk.  The shuttles had created
the hole with pulse bombs, and Corto's team had dropped in
in Nightwing microlights, their wings snapping taut in moon-
light, reflected in jags of silver along the rivers Angara and
Podhamennaya, the last light Corto would see for fifteen months. 
Case tried to imagine the microlights blossoming out of their
launch capsules, high above a frozen steppe.
  `They sure as hell did shaft you, boss,' Case said, and
Molly stirred beside him.
  The microlights had been unarmed, stripped to compensate
for the weight of a console operator, a prototype deck, and a
virus program called Mole IX, the first true virus in the history
of cybernetics.  Corto and his team had been training for the
run for three years.  They were through the ice, ready to inject
Mole IX, when the emps went off.  The Russian pulse guns
threw the jockeys into electronic darkness; the Nightwings suf-
fered systems crash, flight circuitry wiped clean.
  Then the lasers opened up, aiming on infrared, taking out
the fragile, radar-transparent assault planes, and Corto and his
dead console man fell out of a Siberian sky.  Fell and kept
falling...
  There were gaps in the story, here, where Case scanned
documents concerning the flight of a commandeered Russian
gunship that managed to reach Finland.  To be gutted, as it
landed in a spruce grove, by an antique twenty-millimeter can-
non manned by a cadre of reservists on dawn alert.  Screaming
Fist had ended for Corto on the outskirts of Helsinki, with
Finnish paramedics sawing him out of the twisted belly of the
helicopter.  The war ended nine days later, and Corto was shipped
to a military facility in Utah, blind, legless, and missing most
of his jaw.  It took eleven months for the Congressional aide
to find him there.  He listened to the sound of tubes draining. 
In Washington and McLean, the show trials were already un-
derway.  The Pentagon and the CIA were being Balkanized,
partially dismantled, and a Congressional investigation had fo-
cused on Screaming Fist.  Ripe for watergating, the aide told
Corto.
  He'd need eyes, legs, and extensive cosmetic work, the aide
said, but that could be arranged.  New plumbing, the man added,
squeezing Corto's shoulder through the sweat-damp sheet.
  Corto heard the soft, relentless dripping.  He said he pre-
ferred to testify as he was.
  No, the aide explained, the trials were being televised.  The
trials needed to reach the voter.  The aide coughed politely.
  Repaired, refurnished, and extensively rehearsed, Corto's
subsequent testimony was detailed, moving, lucid, and largely
the invention of a Congressional cabal with certain vested in-
terests in saving particular portions of the Pentagon infrastruc-
ture.  Corto gradually understood that the testimony he gave
was instrumental in saving the careers of three officers directly
responsible for the suppression of reports on the building of
the emp installations at Kirensk.
  His role in the trials over, he was unwanted in Washington. 
In an M Street restaurant, over asparagus crepes, the aide ex-
plained the terminal dangers involved in talking to the wrong
people.  Corto crushed the man's larynx with the rigid fingers
of his right hand.  The Congressional aide strangled, his face
in an asparagus crepe, and Corto stepped out into cool Wash-
ington September.
  The Hosaka rattled through police reports, corporate espi-
onage records, and news files.  Case watched Corto work cor-
porate defectors in Lisbon and Marrakesh, where he seemed
to grow obsessed with the idea of betrayal, to loathe the sci-
entists and technicians he bought out for his employers.  Drunk,
in Singapore, he beat a Russian engineer to death in a hotel
and set fire to his room.
  Next he surfaced in Thailand, as overseer of a heroin factory. 
Then as enforcer for a California gambling cartel, then as a
paid killer in the ruins of Bonn.  He robbed a bank in Wichita. 
The record grew vague, shadowy, the gaps longer.
  One day, he said, in a taped segment that suggested chemical
interrogation, everything had gone gray.
  Translated French medical records explained that a man
without identification had been taken to a Paris mental health
unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic.  He became catatonic and
was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of Toulon. 
He became a subject in an experimental program that sought
to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic
models.  A random selection of patients were provided with
microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to
program them.  He was cured, the only success in the entire
experiment.
  The record ended there.
  Case turned on the foam and Molly cursed him softly for
disturbing her.

  The telephone rang.  He pulled it into bed.  `Yeah?'
  `We're going to Istanbul,' Armitage said.  `Tonight.'
  `What does the bastard want?' Molly asked.
  `Says we're going to Istanbul tonight.'
  `That's just wonderful.'
  Armitage was reading off flight numbers and departure times.
  Molly sat up and turned on the light.
  `What about my gear?' Case asked.  `My deck.'
  `Finn will handle it,' said Armitage, and hung up.
  Case watched her pack.  There were dark circles under her
eyes, but even with the cast on, it was like watching a dance. 
No wasted motion.  His clothes were a rumpled pile beside his
bag.
  `You hurting?' he asked.
  `I could do with another night at Chin's.'
  `Your dentist?'
  `You betcha.  Very discreet.  He's got half that rack, full
clinic.  Does repairs for samurai.'  She was zipping her bag. 
`You ever been to 'Stambul?'
  `Couple days, once.'
  `Never changes,' she said.  `Bad old town.'

  `It was like this when we headed for Chiba,' Molly said,
staring out the train window at blasted industrial moonscape,
red beacons on the horizon warning aircraft away from a fusion
plant.  `We were in L.A.  He came in and said Pack, we were
booked for Macau.  When we got there, I played fantan in the
Lisboa and he crossed over into Zhongshan.  Next day I was
playing ghost with you in Night City.'  She took a silk scarf
from the sleeve of her black jacket and polished the insets.  The
landscape of the northern Sprawl woke confused memories of
childhood for Case, dead grass tufting the cracks in a canted
slab of freeway concrete.
  The train began to decelerate ten kilometers from the airport. 
Case watched the sun rise on the landscape of childhood, on
broken slag and the rusting shells of refineries.



        7

  It was raining in Beyoglu, and the rented Mercedes slid past
the grilled and unlit windows of cautious Greek and Armenian
jewelers.  The street was almost empty, only a few dark-coated
figures on the sidewalks turning to stare after the car.
  `This was formerly the prosperous European section of Ot-
toman Istanbul,' purred the Mercedes.
  `So it's gone downhill,' Case said.
  `The Hilton's in Cumhuriyet Caddesi,' Molly said.  She
settled back against the car's gray ultrasuede.
  `How come Armitage flies alone?' Case asked.  He had a
headache.
  `'Cause you get up his nose.  You're sure getting up mine.'
  He wanted to tell her the Corto story, but decided against
it.  He'd used a sleep derm, on the plane.
  The road in from the airport had been dead straight, like a
neat incision, laying the city open.  He'd watched the crazy
walls of patchwork wooden tenements slide by, condos, ar-
cologies, grim housing projects, more walls of plyboard and
corrugated iron.
  The Finn, in a new Shinjuku suit, sarariman black, was
waiting sourly in the Hilton lobby, marooned on a velour arm-
chair in a sea of pale blue carpeting.
  `Christ,' Molly said.  `Rat in a business suit.'
  They crossed the lobby.
  `How much you get paid to come over here, Finn?'  She
lowered her bag beside the armchair.  `Bet not as much as you
get for wearing that suit, huh?'
  The Finn's upper lips drew back.  `Not enough, sweetmeat.' 
He handed her a magnetic key with a round yellow tag.  `You're
registered already.  Honcho's upstairs.'  He looked around.  `This
town sucks.'
  `You get agoraphobic, they take you out from under a dome. 
Just pretend it's Brooklyn or something.'  She twirled the key
around a finger.  `You here as valet or what?'
  `I gotta check out some guy's implants,' the Finn said.
  `How about my deck?' Case asked.
  The Finn winced.  `Observe the protocol.  Ask the boss.'
  Molly's fingers moved in the shadow of her jacket, a flicker
of jive.  The Finn watched, then nodded.
  `Yeah,' she said, `I know who that is.'  She jerked her head
in the direction of the elevators.  `Come on, cowboy.'  Case
followed her with both bags.

  Their room might have been the one in Chiba where he'd
first seen Armitage.  He went to the window, in the morning,
almost expecting to see Tokyo Bay.  There was another hotel
across the street.  It was still raining.  A few letter-writers had
taken refuge in doorways, their old voiceprinters wrapped in
sheets of clear plastic, evidence that the written word still
enjoyed a certain prestige here.  It was a sluggish country.  He
watched a dull black Citroen sedan, a primitive hydrogen-cell
conversion, as it disgorged five sullen-looking Turkish officers
in rumpled green uniforms.  They entered the hotel across the
street.
  He glanced back at the bed, at Molly, and her paleness
struck him.  She'd left the micropore cast on the bedslab in
their loft, beside the transdermal inducer.  Her glasses reflected
part of the room's light fixture.
  He had the phone in his hand before it had a chance to ring
twice.  `Glad you're up,' Armitage said.
  `I'm just.  Lady's still under.  Listen, boss, I think it's maybe
time we have a little talk.  I think I work better if I know a
little more about what I'm doing.'
  Silence on the line.  Case bit his lip.
  `You know as much as you need to.  Maybe more.'
  `You think so?'
  `Get dressed, Case.  Get her up.  You'll have a caller in
about fifteen minutes.  His name is Terzibashjian.'  The phone
bleated softly.  Armitage was gone.
  `Wake up, baby,' Case said.  `Biz.'
  `I've been awake an hour already.'  The mirrors turned.
  `We got a Jersey Bastion coming up.'
  `You got an ear for language, Case.  Bet you're part Ar-
menian.  That's the eye Armitage has had on Riviera.  Help me
up.'
  Terzibashjian proved to be a young man in a gray suit and
gold-framed, mirrored glasses.  His white shirt was open at the
collar, revealing a mat of dark hair so dense that Case at first
mistook it for some kind of t-shirt.  He arrived with a black
Hilton tray arranged with three tiny, fragrant cups of thick
black coffee and three sticky, straw-colored Oriental sweets.
  `We must, as you say in _Ingiliz,_ take this one very easy.' 
He seemed to stare pointedly at Molly, but at last he removed
the silver glasses.  His eyes were a dark brown that matched
the shade of his very short military-cut hair.  He smiled.  `It is
better, this way, yes?  Else we make the _tunel_ infinity, mirror
into mirror...  You particularly,' he said to her, `must take
care.  In Turkey there is disapproval of women who sport such
modifications.'
  Molly bit one of the pastries in half.  `It's my show, Jack,'
she said, her mouth full.  She chewed, swallowed, and licked
her lips.  `I know about you.  Stool for the military, right?'  Her
hand slid lazily into the front of her jacket and came out with
the fletcher.  Case hadn't known she had it.
  `Very easy, please,' Terzibashjian said, his white china
thimble frozen centimeters from his lips.
  She extended the gun.  `Maybe you get the explosives, lots
of them, or maybe you get a cancer.  One dart, shitface.  You
won't feel it for months.'
  `Please.  You call this in _Ingiliz_ making me very tight...'
  `I call it a bad morning.  Now tell us about your man and
get your ass out of here.'  She put the gun away.
  `He is living in Fener, at Kchk Glhane Djaddesi 14.  I
have his _tunel_ route, nightly to the bazaar.  He performs most
recently at the Yenishehir Palas Oteli, a modern place in the
style _turistik,_ but it has been arranged that the police have
shown a certain interest in these shows.  The Yenishehir man-
agement has grown nervous.'  He smiled.  He smelled of some
metallic aftershave.
  `I want to know about the implants,' she said, massaging
her thigh, `I want to know exactly what he can do.'
  Terzibashjian nodded.  `Worst is how you say in _Ingiliz,_ the
subliminals.'  He made the word four careful syllables.

  `On our left,' said the Mercedes, as it steered through a
maze of rainy streets, `is Kapali Carsi, the grand bazaar.'
  Beside Case, the Finn made an appreciative noise, but he
was looking in the wrong direction.  The right side of the street
was lined with miniature scrapyards.  Case saw a gutted loco-
motive atop rust-stained, broken lengths of fluted marble. 
Headless marble statues were stacked like firewood.
  `Homesick?' Case asked.
  `Place sucks,' the Finn said.  His black silk tie was starting
to resemble a worn carbon ribbon.  There were medallions of
kebab gravy and fried egg on the lapels of the new suit.
  `Hey, Jersey,' Case said to the Armenian, who sat behind
them, `where'd this guy get his stuff installed?'
  `In Chiba City.  He has no left lung.  The other is boosted,
is how you say it?  Anyone might buy these implants, but this
one is most talented.'  The Mercedes swerved avoiding a bal-
loon-tired dray stacked with hides.  `I have followed him in the
street and seen a dozen cycles fall, near him, in a day.  Find
the cyclist in a hospital, the story is always the same.  A scorpion
poised beside a brake lever...'
  ``What you see is what you get,' yeah,' the Finn said.  `I
seen the schematics on the guy's silicon.  Very flash.  What he
imagines, you see.  I figure he could narrow it to a pulse and
fry a retina over easy.'
  `You have told this to your woman friend?'  Terzibashjian
leaned forward between the ultrasuede buckets.  `In Turkey,
women are still women.  This one...'
  The Finn snorted.  `She'd have you wearing your balls for
a bow tie if you looked at her cross-eyed.'
  `I do not understand this idiom.'
  `That's okay,' Case said.  `Means shut up.'
  The Armenian sat back, leaving a metallic edge of after-
shave.  He began to whisper to a Sanyo transceiver in a strange
salad of Greek, French, Turkish, isolated fragments of English. 
The transceiver answered in French.  The Mercedes swung
smoothly around a corner.  `The spice bazaar, sometimes called
the Egyptian bazaar,' the car said, `was erected on the site of
an earlier bazaar erected by Sultan Hatice in 1660.  This is the
city's central market for spices, software, perfumes, drugs...'
  `Drugs,' Case said, watching the car's wipers cross and
recross the bulletproof Lexan.  `What's that you said before,
Jersey, about this Riviera being wired?'
  `A mixture of cocaine and meperidine, yes.'  The Armenian
went back to the conversation he was having with the Sanyo.
  `Demerol they used to call that,' said the Finn.  `He's a
speedball artist.  Funny class of people you're mixing with,
Case.'
  `Never mind,' Case said, turning up the collar of his jacket,
`we'll get the poor fucker a new pancreas or something.'

  Once they entered the bazaar, the Finn brightened notice-
ably, as though he were comforted by the crowd density and
the sense of enclosure.  They walked with the Armenian along
a broad concourse, beneath soot-stained sheets of plastic and
green-painted ironwork out of the age of steam.  A thousand
suspended ads writhed and flickered.
  `Hey, Christ,' the Finn said, taking Case's arm, `looka
that.'  He pointed.  `It's a horse, man.  You ever see a horse?'
  Case glanced at the embalmed animal and shook his head. 
It was displayed on a sort of pedestal, near the entrance to a
place that sold birds and monkeys.  The thing's legs had been
worn black and hairless by decades of passing hands.  `Saw
one in Maryland once,' the Finn said, `and that was a good
three years after the pandemic.  There's Arabs still trying to
code 'em up from the DNA, but they always croak.'
  The animal's brown glass eyes seemed to follow them as
they passed.  Terzibashjian led them into a cafe near the core
of the market, a low-ceilinged room that looked as though it
had been in continuous operation for centuries.  Skinny boys
in soiled white coats dodged between the crowded tables, bal-
ancing steel trays with bottles of Turk-Tuborg and tiny glasses
of tea.
  Case bought a pack of Yeheyuans from a vendor by the
door.  The Armenian was muttering to his Sanyo.  `Come,' he
said, `he is moving.  Each night he rides the _tunel_ to the bazaar
to purchase his mixture from Ali.  Your woman is close.  Come.'

  The alley was an old place, too old, the walls cut from
blocks of dark stone.  The pavement was uneven and smelled
of a century's dripping gasoline, absorbed by ancient limestone. 
`Can't see shit,' he whispered to the Finn.  `That's okay for
sweetmeat,' the Finn said.  `Quiet,' said Terzibashjian, too
loudly.
  Wood grated on stone or concrete.  Ten meters down the
alley, a wedge of yellow light fell across wet cobbles, widened. 
A figure stepped out and the door grated shut again, leaving
the narrow place in darkness.  Case shivered.
  `Now,' Terzibashjian said, and a brilliant beam of white
light, directed from the rooftop of the building opposite the
market, pinned the slender figure beside the ancient wooden
door in a perfect circle.  Bright eyes darted left, right, and the
man crumpled.  Case thought someone had shot him; he lay
face down, blond hair pale against the old stone, his limp hands
white and pathetic.
  The floodlight never wavered.
  The back of the fallen man's jacket heaved and burst, blood
splashing the wall and doorway.  A pair of impossibly long,
rope-tendoned arms flexed grayish-pink in the glare.  The thing
seemed to pull itself up out of the pavement, through the inert,
bloody ruin that had been Riviera.  It was two meters tall, stood
on two legs, and seemed to be headless.  Then it swung slowly
to face them, and Case saw that it had a head, but no neck.  It
was eyeless, the skin gleaming a wet intestinal pink.  The mouth,
if it was a mouth, was circular, conical, shallow, and lined
with a seething growth of hairs or bristles, glittering like black
chrome.  It kicked the rags of clothing and flesh aside and took
a step, the mouth seeming to scan for them as it moved.
  Terzibashjian said something in Greek or Turkish and rushed
the thing, his arms spread like a man attempting to dive through
a window.  He went through it.  Into the muzzle-flash of a pistol
from the dark beyond the circle of light.  Fragments of rock
whizzed past Case's head; the Finn jerked him down into a
crouch.
  The light from the rooftop vanished, leaving him with mis-
matched afterimages of muzzle-flash, monster, and white beam. 
His ears rang.
  Then the light returned, bobbing now, searching the shad-
ows.  Terzibashjian was leaning against a steel door, his face
very white in the glare.  He held his left wrist and watched
blood drip from a wound in his left hand.  The blond man,
whole again, unbloodied, lay at his feet.
  Molly stepped out of the shadows, all in black, with her
fletcher in her hand.
  `Use the radio,' the Armenian said, through gritted teeth. 
`Call in Mahmut.  We must get him out of here.  This is not a
good place.'
  `Little prick nearly made it,' the Finn said, his knees crack-
ing loudly as he stood up, brushing ineffectually at the legs of
his trousers.  `You were watching the horror-show, right?  Not
the hamburger that got tossed out of sight.  Real cute.  Well,
help 'em get his ass outa here.  I gotta scan all that gear before
he wakes up, make sure Armitage is getting his money's worth.'
  Molly bent and picked something up.  A pistol.  `A Nambu,'
she said.  `Nice gun.'
  Terzibashjian made a whining sound.  Case saw that most
of his middle finger was missing.

  With the city drenched in predawn blue, she told the Mercedes
to take them to Topkapi.  The Finn and an enormous Turk named
Mahmut had taken Riviera, still unconscious, from the alley. 
Minutes later, a dusty Citroen had arrived for the Armenian,
who seemed on the verge of fainting.
  `You're an asshole,' Molly told the man, opening the ear
door for him.  `You shoulda hung back.  I had him in my sights
as soon as he stepped out.'  Terzibashjian glared at her.  `So
we're through with you anyway.'  She shoved him in and
slammed the door.  `Run into you again and I'll kill you,' she
said to the white face behind the tinted window.  The Citroen
ground away down the alley and swung clumsily into the street.
  Now the Mercedes whispered through Istanbul as the city
woke.  They passed the Beyoglu _tunel_ terminal and sped past
mazes of deserted back streets, run-down apartment houses that
reminded Case vaguely of Paris.
  `What is this thing?' he asked Molly, as the Mercedes
parked itself on the fringes of the gardens that surround the
Seraglio.  He stared dully at the baroque conglomeration of
styles that was Topkapi.
  `It was sort of a private whorehouse for the King,' she said,
getting out stretching.  `Kept a lotta women there.  Now it's a
museum.  Kinda like Finn's shop, all this stuff just jumbled in
there, big diamonds, swords, the left hand of John the
Baptist...'
  `Like in a support vat?'
  `Nah.  Dead.  Got it inside this brass hand thing, little hatch
on the side so the Christians could kiss it for luck.  Got it off
the Christians about a million years ago, and they never dust
the goddam thing, 'cause it's an infidel relic.'
  Black iron deer rusted in the gardens of the Seraglio.  Case
walked beside her, watching the toes of her boots crunch unkept
grass made stiff by an early frost.  They walked beside a path
of cold octagonal flagstones.  Winter was waiting, somewhere
in the Balkans.
  `That Terzi, he's grade-A scum,' she said.  `He's the secret
police.  Torturer.  Real easy to buy out, too, with the kind of
money Armitage was offering.'  In the wet trees around them,
birds began to sing.
  `I did that job for you,' Case said, `the one in London I
got something, but I don't know what it means.'  He told her
the Corto story.
  `Well, I knew there wasn't anybody name of Armitage in
that Screaming Fist.  Looked it up.'  She stroked the rusted
flank of an iron doe.  `You figure the little computer pulled
him out of it?  In that French hospital?'
  `I figure Wintermute,' Case said.
  She nodded.
  `Thing is,' he said, `do you think he knows he was Corto,
before?  I mean, he wasn't anybody in particular, by the time
he hit the ward, so maybe Wintermute just...'
  `Yeah.  Built him up from go.  Yeah...'  She turned and
they walked on.  `It figures.  You know, the guy doesn't have
any life going, in private.  Not as far as I can tell.  You see a
guy like that, you figure there's something he does when he's
alone.  But not Armitage.  Sits and stares at the wall, man.  Then
something clicks and he goes into high gear and wheels for
Wintermute.'
  `So why's he got that stash in London?  Nostalgia?'
  `Maybe he doesn't know about it,' she said.  `Maybe it's
just in his name, right?'
  `I don't get it,' Case said.
  `Just thinking out loud...  How smart's an AI, Case?'
  `Depends.  Some aren't much smarter than dogs.  Pets.  Cost
a fortune anyway.  The real smart ones are as smart as the
Turing heat is willing to let 'em get.'
  `Look, you're a cowboy.  How come you aren't just flat- 
out fascinated with those things?'
  `Well,' he said, `for starts, they're rare.  Most of them are
military, the bright ones, and we can't crack the ice.  That's
where ice all comes from, you know?  And then there's the
Turing cops, and that's bad heat.'  He looked at her.  `I dunno,
it just isn't part of the trip.'
  `Jockeys all the same,' she said.  `No imagination.'
  They came to a broad rectangular pond where carp nuzzled
the stems of some white aquatic flower.  She kicked a loose
pebble in and watched the ripples spread.
  `That's Wintermute,' she said.  `This deal's real big, looks
to me.  We're out where the little waves are too broad, we can't
see the rock that hit the center.  We know something's there,
but not why.  I wanna know why.  I want you to go and talk to
Wintermute.'
  `I couldn't get near it,' he said.  `You're dreaming.'
  `Try.'
  `Can't be done.'
  `Ask the Flatline.'
  `What do we want out of that Riviera?' he asked, hoping
to change the subject.
  She spat into the pond.  `God knows.  I'd as soon kill him
as look at him.  I saw his profile.  He's a kind of compulsive
Judas.  Can't get off sexually unless he knows he's betraying
the object of desire.  That's what the file says.  And they have
to love him first.  Maybe he loves them, too.  That's why it was
easy for Terzi to set him up for us, because he's been here
three years, shopping politicals to the secret police.  Probably
Terzi let him watch, when the cattle prods came out.  He's done
eighteen in three years.  All women age twenty to twenty-five. 
It kept Terzi in dissidents.'  She thrust her hands into her jacket
pockets.  `Because if he found one he really wanted, he'd make
sure she turned political.  He's got a personality like a Modern's
suit.  The profile said it was a very rare type, estimated one in
a couple of million.  Which anyway says something good about
human nature, I guess.'  She stared at the white flowers and
the sluggish fish, her face sour.  `I think I'm going to have to
buy myself some special insurance on that Peter.'  Then she
turned and smiled, and it was very cold.
  `What's that mean?'
  `Never mind.  Let's go back to Beyoglu and find something
like breakfast.  I gotta busy night again, tonight.  Gotta collect
his stuff from that apartment in Fener, gotta go back to the
bazaar and buy him some drugs...'
  `Buy him some drugs?  How's he rate?'
  She laughed.  `He's not dying on the wire, sweetheart.  And
it looks like he can't work without that special taste.  I like you
better now, anyway, you aren't so goddam skinny.'  She smiled. 
`So I'll go to Ali the dealer and stock up.  You betcha.'

  Armitage was waiting in their room at the Hilton.
  `Time to pack,' he said, and Case tried to find the man
called Corto behind the pale blue eyes and the tanned mask. 
He thought of Wage, back in Chiba.  Operators above a certain
level tended to submerge their personalities, he knew.  But
Wage had had vices, lovers.  Even, it had been rumored, chil-
dren.  The blankness he found in Armitage was something else.
  `Where to now?' he asked, walking past the man to stare
down into the street.  `What kind of climate?'
  `They don't have climate, just weather,' Armitage said. 
`Here.  Read the brochure.'  He put something on the coffee
table and stood.
  `Did Riviera check out okay?  Where's the Finn?'
  `Riviera's fine.  The Finn is on his way home.'  Armitage
smiled, a smile that meant as much as the twitch of some
insect's antenna.  His gold bracelet clinked as he reached out
to prod Case in the chest.  `Don't get too smart.  Those little
sacs are starting to show wear, but you don't know how much.'
  Case kept his face very still and forced himself to nod.
  When Armitage was gone, he picked up one of the bro-
chures.  It was expensively printed, in French, English, and
Turkish.
  FREESIDE -- WHY WAIT?

  The four of them were booked on a _THY_ flight out of Yes-
ilky airport.  Transfer at Paris to the _JAL_ shuttle.  Case sat in
the lobby of the Istanbul Hilton and watched Riviera browse
bogus Byzantine fragments in the glass-walled gift shop.  Ar-
mitage, his trenchcoat draped over his shoulders like a cape,
stood in the shop's entrance.
  Riviera was slender, blond, soft-voiced, his English ac-
centless and fluid.  Molly said he was thirty, but it would have
been difficult to guess his age.  She also said he was legally
stateless and traveled under a forged Dutch passport.  He was
a product of the rubble rings that fringe the radioactive core
of old Bonn.
  Three smiling Japanese tourists bustled into the shop, nod-
ding politely to Armitage.  Armitage crossed the floor of the
shop too quickly, too obviously, to stand beside Riviera.  Ri-
viera turned and smiled.  He was very beautiful; Case assumed
the features were the work of a Chiba surgeon.  A subtle job,
nothing like Armitage's blandly handsome blend of pop faces. 
The man's forehead was high and smooth, gray eyes calm and
distant.  His nose, which might have been too nicely sculpted,
seemed to have been broken and clumsily reset.  The suggestion
of brutality offset the delicacy of his jaw and the quickness of
his smile.  His teeth were small, even, and very white.  Case
watched the white hands play over the imitation fragments of
sculpture.
  Riviera didn't act like a man who'd been attacked the night
before, drugged with a toxin-flechette, abducted, subjected to
the Finn's examination, and pressured by Armitage into joining
their team.
  Case checked his watch.  Molly was due back from her drug
run.  He looked up at Riviera again.  `I bet you're stoned right
now, asshole,' he said to the Hilton lobby.  A graying Italian
matron in a white leather tuxedo jacket lowered her Porsche
glasses to stare at him.  He smiled broadly, stood, and shoul-
dered his bag.  He needed cigarettes for the flight.  He wondered
if there was a smoking section on the _JAL_ shuttle.  `See ya,
lady,' he said to the woman, who promptly slid the sunglasses
back up her nose and turned away.
  There were cigarettes in the gift shop, but he didn't relish
talking with Armitage or Riviera.  He left the lobby and located
a vending console in a narrow alcove, at the end of a rank of
pay phones.
  He fumbled through a pocketful of lirasi, slotting the small
dull alloy coins one after another, vaguely amused by the anach-
ronism of the process.  The phone nearest him rang.
  Automatically, he picked it up.
  `Yeah?'
  Faint harmonics, tiny inaudible voices rattling across some
orbital link, and then a sound like wind.
  `Hello, Case.'
  A fifty-lirasi coin fell from his hand, bounced, and rolled
out of sight across Hilton carpeting.
  `Wintermute, Case.  It's time we talk.'
  It was a chip voice.
  `Don't you want to talk, Case?'
  He hung up.
  On his way back to the lobby, his cigarettes forgotten, he
had to walk the length of the ranked phones.  Each rang in turn,
but only once, as he passed.



        PART THREE
        MIDNIGHT IN THE RUE JULES VERNE


        8

  Archipelago.
  The islands.  Torus, spindle, cluster.  Human DNA spreading
out from gravity's steep well like an oilslick.
  Call up a graphics display that grossly simplifies the ex-
change of data in the L-5 archipelago.  One segment clicks in
as red solid, a massive rectangle dominating your screen.
  Freeside.  Freeside is many things, not all of them evident
to the tourists who shuttle up and down the well.  Freeside is
brothel and banking nexus, pleasure dome and free port, bor-
der town and spa.  Freeside is Las Vegas and the hanging gar-
dens of Babylon, an orbital Geneva and home to a family inbred
and most carefully refined, the industrial clan of Tessier and
Ashpool.

  On the _THY_ liner to Paris, they sat together in First Class,
Molly in the window seat, Case beside her, Riviera and Ar-
mitage on the aisle.  Once, as the plane banked over water,
Case saw the jewel-glow of a Greek island town.  And once,
reaching for his drink, he caught the flicker of a thing like a
giant human sperm in the depths of his bourbon and water.
  Molly leaned across him and slapped Riviera's face, once. 
`No, baby.  No games.  You play that subliminal shit around
me, I'll hurt you real bad.  I can do it without damaging you
at all.  I _like_ that.'
  Case turned automatically to check Armitage's reaction.  The
smooth face was calm, the blue eyes alert, but there was no
anger.  `That's right, Peter.  Don't.'
  Case turned back, in time to catch the briefest flash of a
black rose, its petals sheened like leather, the black stem thorned
with bright chrome.
  Peter Riviera smiled sweetly, closed his eyes, and fell in-
stantly asleep.
  Molly turned away, her lenses reflected in the dark window.

  `You been up, haven't you?' Molly asked, as he squirmed
his way back into the deep temperfoam couch on the _JAL_
shuttle.
  `Nah.  Never travel much, just for biz.'  The steward was
attaching readout trodes to his wrist and left ear.
  `Hope you don't get SAS,' she said.
  `Airsick?  No way.'
  `It's not the same.  Your heartbeat'll speed up in zero-g, and
your inner ear'll go nuts for a while.  Kicks in your flight reflex,
like you'll be getting signals to run like hell, and a lot of
adrenaline.'  The steward moved on to Riviera, taking a new
set of trodes from his red plastic apron.
  Case turned his head and tried to make out the outline of
the old Orly terminals, but the shuttle pad was screened by
graceful blast-deflectors of wet concrete.  The one nearest the
window bore an Arabic slogan in red spraybomb.
  He closed his eyes and told himself the shuttle was only a
big airplane, one that flew very high.  It smelled like an airplane,
like new clothes and chewing gum and exhaustion.  He listened
to the piped koto music and waited.
  Twenty minutes, then gravity came down on him like a
great soft hand with bones of ancient stone.

  Space adaptation syndrome was worse than Molly's de-
scription, but it passed quickly enough and he was able to
sleep.  The steward woke him as they were preparing to dock
at _JAL_'s terminal cluster.
  `We transfer to Freeside now?' he asked, eyeing a shred
of Yeheyuan tobacco that had drifted gracefully up out of his
shirt pocket to dance ten centimeters from his nose.  There was
no smoking on shuttle flights.
  `No, we got the boss's usual little kink in the plans, you
know?  We're getting this taxi out to Zion, Zion cluster.'  She
touched the release plate on her harness and began to free
herself from the embrace of the foam.  `Funny choice of venue,
you ask me.'
  `How's that?'
  `Dreads.  Rastas.  Colony's about thirty years old now.'
  `What's that mean?'
  `You'll see.  It's an okay place by me.  Anyway, they'll let
you smoke your cigarettes there.'

  Zion had been founded by five workers who'd refused to
return, who'd turned their backs on the well and started build-
ing.  They'd suffered calcium loss and heart shrinkage before
rotational gravity was established in the colony's central torus. 
Seen from the bubble of the taxi, Zion's makeshift hull re-
minded Case of the patchwork tenements of Istanbul, the ir-
regular, discolored plates laser-scrawled with Rastafarian
symbols and the initials of welders.
  Molly and a skinny Zionite called Aerol helped Case ne-
gotiate a freefall corridor into the core of a smaller torus.  He'd
lost track of Armitage and Riviera in the wake of a second
wave of SAS vertigo.  `Here,' Molly said, shoving his legs
into a narrow hatchway overhead.  `Grab the rungs.  Make like
you're climbing backward, right?  You're going toward the hull,
that's like you're climbing down into gravity.  Got it?'
  Case's stomach churned.
  `You be fine, mon,' Aerol said, his grin bracketed with
gold incisors.
  Somehow, the end of the tunnel had become its bottom. 
Case embraced the weak gravity like a drowning man finding
a pocket of air.
  `Up,' Molly said, `you gonna kiss it next?'  Case lay flat
on the deck, on his stomach, arms spread.  Something struck
him on the shoulder.  He rolled over and saw a fat bundle of
elastic cable.  `Gotta play house,' she said.  `You help me string
this up.'  He looked around the wide, featureless space and
noticed steel rings welded on every surface, seemingly at ran-
dom.
  When they'd strung the cables, according to some complex
scheme of Molly's, they hung them with battered sheets of
yellow plastic.  As they worked, Case gradually became aware
of the music that pulsed constantly through the cluster.  It was
called dub, a sensuous mosaic cooked from vast libraries of
digitalized pop; it was worship, Molly said, and a sense of
community.  Case heaved at one of the yellow sheets; the thing
was light but still awkward.  Zion smelled of cooked vegetables,
humanity, and ganja.
  `Good,' Armitage said, gliding loose-kneed through the
hatch and nodding at the maze of sheets.  Riviera followed, less
certain in the partial gravity.
  `Where were you when it needed doing?' Case asked Ri-
viera.
  The man opened his mouth to speak.  A small trout swam
out, trailing impossible bubbles.  It glided past Case's cheek. 
`In the head,' Riviera said, and smiled.
  Case laughed.
  `Good,' Riviera said, `you can laugh.  I would have tried
to help you, but I'm no good with my hands.'  He held up his
palms, which suddenly doubled.  Four arms, four hands.
  `Just the harmless clown, right, Riviera?'  Molly stepped
between them.
  `Yo,' Aerol said, from the hatch, `you wan'~ come wi'~ me,
cowboy mon.'
  `It's your deck,' Armitage said, `and the other gear.  Help
him get it in from the cargo bay.'
  `You ver'~ pale, mon,' Aerol said, as they were guiding the
foam-bundled Hosaka terminal along the central corridor. 
`Maybe you wan'~ eat somethin'~.'
  Case's mouth flooded with saliva; he shook his head.

  Armitage announced an eighty-hour stay in Zion.  Molly and
Case would practice in zero gravity, he said, and acclimatize
themselves to working in it.  He would brief them on Freeside
and the Villa Straylight.  It was unclear what Riviera was sup-
posed to be doing, but Case didn't feel like asking.  A few
hours after their arrival, Armitage had sent him into the yellow
maze to call Riviera out for a meal.  He'd found him curled
like a cat on a thin pad of temperfoam, naked, apparently
asleep, his head orbited by a revolving halo of small white
geometric forms, cubes, spheres, and pyramids.  `Hey, Ri-
viera.'  The ring continued to revolve.  He'd gone back and told
Armitage.  `He's stoned,' Molly said, looking up from the
disassembled parts of her fletcher.  `Leave him be.'
  Armitage seemed to think that zero-g would affect Case's
ability to operate in the matrix.  `Don't sweat it,' Case argued,
`I jack in and I'm not here.  It's all the same.'
  `Your adrenaline levels are higher,' Armitage said.  `You've
still got SAS.  You won't have time for it to wear off.  You're
going to learn to work with it.'
  `So I do the run from here?'
  `No.  Practice, Case.  Now.  Up in the corridor...'

  Cyberspace, as the deck presented it, had no particular re-
lationship with the deck's physical whereabouts.  When Case
jacked in, he opened his eyes to the familiar configuration of
the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority's Aztec pyramid of
data.
  `How you doing, Dixie?'
  `I'm dead, Case.  Got enough time in on this Hosaka to
figure that one.'
  `How's it feel?'
  `It doesn't.'
  `Bother you?'
  `What bothers me is, nothin'~ does.'
  `How's that?'
  `Had me this buddy in the Russian camp, Siberia, his thumb
was frostbit.  Medics came by and they cut it off.  Month later
he's tossin'~ all night.  Elroy, I said, what's eatin'~ you?  Goddam
thumb's itchin'~, he says.  So I told him, scratch it.  McCoy, he
says, it's the _other_ goddam thumb.'  When the construct laughed,
it came through as something else, not laughter, but a stab of
cold down Case's spine.  `Do me a favor, boy.'
  `What's that, Dix?'
  `This scam of yours, when it's over, you erase this goddam
thing.'

  Case didn't understand the Zionites.
  Aerol, with no particular provocation, related the tale of the
baby who had burst from his forehead and scampered into a
forest of hydroponic ganja.  `Ver'~ small baby, mon, no long'~
you finga.'  He rubbed his palm across an unscarred expanse
of brown forehead and smiled.
  `It's the ganja,' Molly said, when Case told her the story. 
`They don't make much of a difference between states, you
know?  Aerol tells you it happened, well, it happened to _him._ 
It's not like bullshit, more like poetry.  Get it?'
  Case nodded dubiously.  The Zionites always touched you
when they were talking, hands on your shoulder.  He didn't
like that.
  `Hey, Aerol,' Case called, an hour later, as he prepared
for a practice run in the freefall corridor.  `Come here, man. 
Wanna show you this thing.'  He held out the trodes.
  Aerol executed a slow-motion tumble.  His bare feet struck
the steel wall and he caught a girder with his free hand.  The
other held a transparent waterbag bulging with blue-green al-
gae.  He blinked mildly and grinned.
  `Try it,' Case said.
  He took the band, put it on, and Case adjusted the trodes. 
He closed his eyes.  Case hit the power stud.  Aerol shuddered. 
Case jacked him back out.  `What did you see, man?'
  `Babylon,' Aerol said, sadly, handing him the trodes and
kicking off down the corridor.

  Riviera sat motionless on his foam pad, his right arm ex-
tended straight out, level with his shoulder.  A jewel-scaled
snake, its eyes like ruby neon, was coiled tightly a few
millimeters behind his elbow.  Case watched the snake, which
was finger-thick and banded black and scarlet, slowly contract,
tightening around Riviera's arm.
  `Come then,' the man said caressingly to the pale waxy
scorpion poised in the center of his upturned palm.  `Come.' 
The scorpion swayed its brownish claws and scurried up his
arm its feet tracking the faint dark telltales of veins.  When it
reached the inner elbow, it halted and seemed to vibrate.  Ri-
viera made a soft hissing sound.  The sting came up, quivered,
and sank into the skin above a bulging vein.  The coral snake
relaxed, and Riviera sighed slowly as the injection hit him.
  Then the snake and the scorpion were gone, and he held a
milky plastic syringe in his left hand.  ``If God made anything
better, he kept it for himself.'  You know the expression, Case?'
  `Yeah,' Case said.  `I heard that about lots of different
things.  You always make it into a little show?'
  Riviera loosened and removed the elastic length of surgical
tubing from his arm.  `Yes.  It's more fun.'  He smiled, his eyes
distant now, cheeks flushed.  `I've a membrane set in, just over
the vein, so I never have to worry about the condition of the
needle.'
  `Doesn't hurt?'
  The bright eyes met his.  `Of course it does.  That's part of
it, isn't it?'
  `I'd just use derms,' Case said.
  `Pedestrian,' Riviera sneered, and laughed, putting on a
short-sleeved white cotton shirt.
  `Must be nice,' Case said, getting up.
  `Get high yourself, Case?'
  `I hadda give it up.'

  `Freeside,' Armitage said, touching the panel on the little
Braun hologram projector.  The image shivered into focus, nearly
three meters from tip to tip.  `Casinos here.'  He reached into
the skeletal representation and pointed.  `Hotels, strata-title
property, big shops along here.'  His hand moved.  `Blue areas
are lakes.'  He walked to one end of the model.  `Big cigar. 
Narrows at the ends.'
  `We can see that fine,' Molly said.
  `Mountain effect, as it narrows.  Ground seems to get higher,
more rocky, but it's an easy climb.  Higher you climb, the
lower the gravity.  Sports up there.  There's velodrome ring
here.'  He pointed.
  `A what?'  Case leaned forward.
  `They race bicycles,' Molly said.  `Low grav, high-traction
tires, get up over a hundred kilos an hour.'
  `This end doesn't concern us,' Armitage said with his usual
utter seriousness.
  `Shit,' Molly said, `I'm an avid cyclist.'
  Riviera giggled.
  Armitage walked to the opposite end of the projection.  `This
end does.'  The interior detail of the hologram ended here, and
the final segment of the spindle was empty.  `This is the Villa
Straylight.  Steep climb out of gravity and every approach is
kinked.  There's a single entrance, here, dead center.  Zero grav-
ity.'
  `What's inside, boss?'  Riviera leaned forward, craning his
neck.  Four tiny figures glittered, near the tip of Armitage's
finger.  Armitage slapped at them as if they were gnats.
  `Peter,' Armitage said, `you're going to be the first to find
out.  You'll arrange yourself an invitation.  Once you're in, you
see that Molly gets in.'
  Case stared at the blankness that represented Straylight,
remembering the Finn's story: Smith, Jimmy, the talking head,
and the ninja.
  `Details available?' Riviera asked.  `I need to plan a ward-
robe, you see.'
  `Learn the streets,' Armitage said, returning to the center
of the model.  `Desiderata Street here.  This is the Rue Jules
Verne.'
  Riviera rolled his eyes.
  While Armitage recited the names of Freeside avenues, a
dozen bright pustules rose on his nose, cheeks, and chin.  Even
Molly laughed.
  Armitage paused, regarded them all with his cold empty
eyes.
  `Sorry,' Riviera said, and the sores flickered and vanished.

  Case woke, late into the sleeping period, and became aware
of Molly crouched beside him on the foam.  He could feel her
tension.  He lay there confused.  When she moved, the sheer
speed of it stunned him.  She was up and through the sheet of
yellow plastic before he'd had time to realize she'd slashed it
open.
  `Don't you move, friend.'
  Case rolled over and put his head through the rent in the
plastic.  `Wha...?'
  `Shut up.'
  `You th'~ one, mon,' said a Zion voice.  `Cateye, call 'em,
call 'em Steppin'~ Razor.  I Maelcum, sister.  Brothers wan'~
converse wi'~ you an'~ cowboy.'
  `What brothers?'
  `Founders, mon.  Elders of Zion, ya know...'
  `We open that hatch, the light'll wake bossman,' Case
whispered.
  `Make it special dark, now,' the man said.  `Come.  I an'~ I
visit th'~ Founders.'
  `You know how fast I can cut you, friend?'
  `Don'~ stan'~ talkin'~, sister.  Come.'

  The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with
the accelerated aging that overtakes men who spend too many
years outside the embrace of gravity.  Their brown legs, brittle
with calcium loss, looked fragile in the harsh glare of reflected
sunlight.  They floated in the center of a painted jungle of
rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely cov-
ered the hull of the spherical chamber.  The air was thick with
resinous smoke.
  `Steppin'~ Razor,' one said, as Molly drifted into the cham-
ber.  `Like unto a whippin'~ stick.'
  `That is a story we have, sister,' said the other, `a religion
story.  We are glad you've come with Maelcum.'
  `How come you don't talk the patois?' Molly asked.
  `I came from Los Angeles,' the old man said.  His dread-
locks were like a matted tree with branches the color of steel
wool.  `Long time ago, up the gravity well and out of Babylon. 
To lead the Tribes home.  Now my brother likens you to Step-
pin'~ Razor.'
  Molly extended her right hand and the blades flashed in the
smoky air.
  The other Founder laughed, his head thrown back.  `Soon
come, the Final Days...  Voices.  Voices cryin'~ inna wilder-
ness, prophesyin'~ ruin unto Babylon...'
  `Voices.'  The Founder from Los Angeles was staring at
Case.  `We monitor many frequencies.  We listen always.  Came
a voice, out of the babel of tongues, speaking to us.  It played
us a mighty dub.'
  `Call 'em Winter Mute,' said the other, making it two
words.
  Case felt the skin crawl on his arms.
  `The Mute talked to us,' the first Founder said.  `The Mute
said we are to help you.'
  `When was this?' Case asked.
  `Thirty hours prior you dockin'~ Zion.'
  `You ever hear this voice before?'
  `No,' said the man from Los Angeles, `and we are uncertain
of its meaning.  If these are Final Days, we must expect false
prophets...'
  `Listen,' Case said, `that's an AI, you know?  Artificial
intelligence.  The music it played you, it probably just tapped
your banks and cooked up whatever it thought you'd like
to --'
  `Babylon,' broke in the other Founder, `mothers many de-
mon, I an'~ I know.  Multitude horde!'
  `What was that you called me, old man?' Molly asked.
  `Steppin'~ Razor.  An'~ you bring a scourge on Babylon, sis-
ter, on its darkest heart...'
  `What kinda message the voice have?' Case asked.
  `We were told to help you,' the other said, `that you might
serve as a tool of Final Days.'  His lined face was troubled. 
`We were told to send Maelcum with you, in his tug _Garvey_
to the Babylon port of Freeside.  And this we shall do.'
  `Maelcum a rude boy,' said the other, `an'~ a righteous tug
pilot.'
  `But we have decided to send Aerol as well, in _Babylon
Rocker,_ to watch over _Garvey.'_
  An awkward silence filled the dome.
  `That's it?' Case asked.  `You guys work for Armitage or
what?'
  `We rent you space,' said the Los Angeles Founder.  `We
have a certain involvement here with various traffics, and no
regard for Babylon's law.  Our law is the word of Jah.  But this
time, it may be, we have been mistaken.'
  `Measure twice, cut once,' said the other, softly.
  `Come on, Case,' Molly said.  `Let's get back before the
man figures out we're gone.'
  `Maelcum will take you.  Jah love, sister.'



        9

  The tug _Marcus Garvey,_ a steel drum nine meters long and
two in diameter, creaked and shuddered as Maelcum punched
for a navigational burn.  Splayed in his elastic g-web, Case
watched the Zionite's muscular back through a haze of sco-
polamine.  He'd taken the drug to blunt SAS nausea, but the
stimulants the manufacturer included to counter the scop had
no effect on his doctored system.
  `How long's it gonna take us to make Freeside?' Molly
asked from her web beside Maelcum's pilot module.
  `Don be long now, m'seh dat.'
  `You guys ever think in hours?'
  `Sister, time, it be time, ya know wha mean?  Dread,' and
he shook his locks, `at control, mon, an'~ I an'~ I come a Freeside
when I an'~ I come...'
  `Case,' she said, `have you maybe done anything toward
getting in touch with our pal from Berne?  Like all that time
you spent in Zion, plugged in with your lips moving?'
  `Pal,' Case said, `sure.  No.  I haven't.  But I got a funny
story along those lines, left over from Istanbul.'  He told her
about the phones in the Hilton.
  `Christ,' she said, `there goes a chance.  How come you
hung up?'
  `Coulda been anybody,' he lied.  `Just a chip...  I dunno.' 
He shrugged.
  `Not just 'cause you were scared, huh?'
  He shrugged again.
  `Do it now.'
  `What?'
  `Now.  Anyway, talk to the Flatline about it.'
  `I'm all doped,' he protested, but reached for the trodes. 
His deck and the Hosaka had been mounted behind Maelcum's
module along with a very high-resolution Cray monitor.
  He adjusted the trodes.  _Marcus Garvey_ had been thrown
together around an enormous old Russian air scrubber, a rec-
tangular thing daubed with Rastafarian symbols, Lions of Zion
and Black Star Liners, the reds and greens and yellows over-
laying wordy decals in Cyrillic script.  Someone had sprayed
Maelcum's pilot gear a hot tropical pink, scraping most of the
overspray off the screens and readouts with a razor blade.  The
gaskets around the airlock in the bow were festooned with
semirigid globs and streamers of translucent caulk, like clumsy
strands of imitation seaweed.  He glanced past Maelcum's
shoulder to the central screen and saw a docking display: the
tug's path was a line of red dots, Freeside a segmented green
circle.  He watched the line extend itself, generating a new dot.
  He jacked in.
  `Dixie?'
  `Yeah.'
  `You ever try to crack an AI?'
  `Sure.  I flatlined.  First time.  I was larkin'~, jacked up real
high, out by Rio heavy commerce sector.  Big biz, multina-
tionals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree.  Just
larkin'~ around, you know?  And then I started picking up on
this one cube, maybe three levels higher up.  Jacked up there
and made a pass.'
  `What did it look like, the visual?'
  `White cube.'
  `How'd you know it was an AI?'
  `How'd I know?  Jesus.  It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. 
So what else was it?  The military down there don't have any-
thing like that.  Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to
look it up.'
  `Yeah?'
  `It was on the Turing Registry.  AI.  Frog company owned
its Rio mainframe.'
  Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus
of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite
neuroelectronic void of the matrix.  `Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?'
  `Tessier, yeah.'
  `And you went back?'
  `Sure.  I was crazy.  Figured I'd try to cut it.  Hit the first
strata and that's all she wrote.  My joeboy smelled the skin
frying and pulled the trodes off me.  Mean shit, that ice.'
  `And your EEG was flat.'
  `Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?'
  Case jacked out.  `Shit,' he said, `how do you think Dixie
got himself flatlined, huh?  Trying to buzz an AI.  Great...'
  `Go on,' she said, `the two of you are supposed to be
dynamite, right?'

  `Dix,' Case said, `I wanna have a look at an AI in Berne. 
Can you think of any reason not to?'
  `Not unless you got a morbid fear of death, no.'
  Case punched for the Swiss banking sector, feeling a wave
of exhilaration as cyberspace shivered, blurred, gelled.  The
Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority was gone, replaced by the
cool geometric intricacy of Zurich commercial banking.  He
punched again, for Berne.
  `Up,' the construct said.  `It'll be high.'
  They ascended lattices of light, levels strobing, a blue flicker.
  That'll be it, Case thought.
  Wintermute was a simple cube of white light, that very
simplicity suggesting extreme complexity.
  `Don't look much, does it?' the Flatline said.  `But just you
try and touch it.'
  `I'm going in for a pass, Dixie.'
  `Be my guest.'
  Case punched to within four grid points of the cube.  Its
blank face, towering above him now, began to seethe with faint
internal shadows, as though a thousand dancers whirled behind
a vast sheet of frosted glass.
  `Knows we're here,' the Flatline observed.
  Case punched again, once; they jumped forward by a single
grid point.
  A stippled gray circle formed on the face of the cube.
  `Dixie...'
  `Back off, fast.'
  The gray area bulged smoothly, became a sphere, and de-
tached itself from the cube.
  Case felt the edge of the deck sting his palm as he slapped
MAX REVERSE.  The matrix blurred backward; they plunged
down a twilit shaft of Swiss banks.  He looked up.  The sphere
was darker now, gaining on him.  Falling.
  `Jack out,' the Flatline said.
  The dark came down like a hammer.

  Cold steel odor and ice caressed his spine.
  And faces peering in from a neon forest, sailors and hustlers
and whores, under a poisoned silver sky...
  `Look, Case, you tell me what the fuck is going on with
you, you wig or something?'
  A steady pulse of pain, midway down his spine --

  Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled in coils of
discarded fiberoptics.  The arcade's sea of sound washed over
him, receded, returned.  Rolling over, he sat up and held his
head.
  Light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed
him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis
of a gutted game console.  Streamlined Japanese was stenciled
across the side of the console in faded pinks and yellows.
  He glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window, a faint glow
of fluorescents.
  His back hurt, his spine.
  He got to his feet, brushed wet hair out of his eyes.
  Something had happened...
  He searched his pockets for money, found nothing, and
shivered.  Where was his jacket?  He tried to find it, looked
behind the console, but gave up.
  On Ninsei, he took the measure of the crowd.  Friday.  It
to be a Friday.  Linda was probably in the arcade.  Might
have money, or at least cigarettes...  Coughing, wringing rain
from the front of his shirt, he edged through the crowd to the
arcade's entrance.
  Holograms twisted and shuddered to the roaring of the games,
ghosts overlapping in the crowded haze of the place, a smell
of sweat and bored tension.  A sailor in a white t-shirt nuked
Bonn on a Tank War console, an azure flash.
  She was playing Wizard's Castle, lost in it, her gray eyes
rimmed with smudged black paintstick.
  She looked up as he put his arm around her, smiled.  `Hey. 
How you doin'~?  Look wet.'
  He kissed her.
  `You made me blow my game,' she said.  `Look there,
asshole.  Seventh level dungeon and the goddam vampires got
me.'  She passed him a cigarette.  `You look pretty strung, man. 
Where you been?'
  `I don't know.'
  `You high, Case?  Drinkin'~ again?  Eatin'~ Zone's dex?'
  `Maybe... how long since you seen me?'
  `Hey, it's a put-on, right?'  She peered at him.  `Right?'
  `No.  Some kind of blackout.  I...  I woke up in the alley.'
  `Maybe somebody decked you, baby.  Got your roll intact?'
  He shook his head.
  `There you go.  You need a place to sleep, Case?'
  `I guess so.'
  `Come on, then.'  She took his hand.  `We'll get you a coffee
and something to eat.  Take you home.  It's good to see you,
man.'  She squeezed his hand.
  He smiled.
  Something cracked.
  Something shifted at the core of things.  The arcade froze,
vibrated --
  She was gone.  The weight of memory came down, an entire
body of knowledge driven into his head like a microsoft into
a socket.  Gone.  He smelled burning meat.
  The sailor in the white t-shirt was gone.  The arcade was
empty, silent.  Case turned slowly, his shoulders hunched, teeth
bared, his hands bunched into involuntary fists.  Empty.  A
crumpled yellow candy wrapper, balanced on the edge of a
console, dropped to the floor and lay amid flattened butts and
styrofoam cups.
  `I had a cigarette,' Case said, looking down at his white- 
knuckled fist.  `I had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep. 
Do you hear me, you son of a bitch?  You hear me?'
  Echoes moved through the hollow of the arcade, fading
down corridors of consoles.
  He stepped out into the street.  The rain had stopped.
  Ninsei was deserted.
  Holograms flickered, neon danced.  He smelled boiled veg-
etables from a vendor's pushcart across the street.  An unopened
pack of Yeheyuans lay at his feet, beside a book of matches. 
JULIUS DEANE IMPORT EXPORT.  Case stared at the printed
logo and its Japanese translation.
  `Okay,' he said, picking up the matches and opening the
pack of cigarettes.  `I hear you.'

  He took his time climbing the stairs of Deane's office.  No
rush, he told himself, no hurry.  The sagging face of the Dali
clock still told the wrong time.  There was dust on the Kandinsky
table and the Neo-Aztec bookcases.  A wall of white fiberglass
shipping modules filled the room with a smell of ginger.
  `Is the door locked?'  Case waited for an answer, but none
came.  He crossed to the office door and tried it.  `Julie?'
  The green-shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on Deane's
desk.  Case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cas-
settes, crumpled printouts, at sticky plastic bags filled with
ginger samples.
  There was no one there.
  Case stepped around the broad steel desk and pushed Deane's
chair out of the way.  He found the gun in a cracked leather
holster fastened beneath the desk with silver tape.  It was an
antique, a .357 Magnum with the barrel and trigger-guard sawn
off.  The grip had been built up with layers of masking tape. 
The tape was old, brown, shiny with a patina of dirt.  He flipped
the cylinder out and examined each of the six cartridges.  They
were handloads.  The soft lead was still bright and untarnished.
  With the revolver in his right hand, Case edged past the
cabinet to the left of the desk and stepped into the center of
the cluttered office, away from the pool of light.
  `I guess I'm not in any hurry.  I guess it's your show.  But
all this shit, you know, it's getting kind of... old.'  He raised
the gun with both hands, aiming for the center of the desk,
and pulled the trigger.
  The recoil nearly broke his wrist.  The muzzle-flash lit the
office like a flashbulb.  With his ears ringing, he stared at the
jagged hole in the front of the desk.  Explosive bullet.  Azide. 
He raised the gun again.
  `You needn't do that, old son,' Julie said, stepping out of
the shadows.  He wore a three-piece drape suit in silk herring-
bone, a striped shirt, and a bow tie.  His glasses winked in the
light.
  Case brought the gun around and looked down the line of
sight at Deane's pink, ageless face.
  `Don't,' Deane said.  `You're right.  About what this all is. 
What I am.  But there are certain internal logics to be honored. 
If you use that, you'll see a lot of brains and blood, and it
would take me several hours -- your subjective time -- to effect
another spokesperson.  This set isn't easy for me to maintain. 
Oh, and I'm sorry about Linda, in the arcade.  I was hoping to
speak through her, but I'm generating all this out of your
memories, and the emotional charge...  Well, it's very tricky. 
I slipped.  Sorry.'
  Case lowered the gun.  `This is the matrix.  You're Winter-
mute.'
  `Yes.  This is all coming to you courtesy of the simstim unit
wired into your deck, of course.  I'm glad I was able to cut you
off before you'd managed to jack out.'  Deane walked around
the desk, straightened his chair, and sat down.  `Sit, old son. 
We have a lot to talk about.'
  `Do we?'
  `Of course we do.  We have had for some time.  I was ready
when I reached you by phone in Istanbul.  Time's very short
now.  You'll be making your run in a matter of days, Case.' 
Deane picked up a bonbon and stripped off its checkered wrap-
per, popped it into his mouth.  `Sit,' he said around the candy.
  Case lowered himself into the swivel chair in front of the
desk without taking his eyes off Deane.  He sat with the gun
in his hand, resting it on his thigh.
  `Now,' Deane said briskly, `order of the day.  `What,' you're
asking yourself, `is Wintermute?'  Am I right?'
  `More or less.'
  `An artificial intelligence, but you know that.  Your mistake,
and it's quite a logical one, is in confusing the Wintermute
mainframe, Berne, with the Wintermute _entity.'_  Deane sucked
his bonbon noisily.  `You're already aware of the other AI in
Tessier-Ashpool's link-up, aren't you?  Rio.  I, insofar as I _have_
an `I' -- this gets rather metaphysical, you see -- I am the one
who arranges things for Armitage.  Or Corto, who, by the way,
is quite unstable.  Stable enough,' said Deane and withdrew an
ornate gold watch from a vest pocket and flicked it open, `for
the next day or so.'
  `You make about as much sense as anything in this deal
ever has,' Case said, massaging his temples with his free hand. 
`If you're so goddam smart...'
  `Why ain't I rich?'  Deane laughed, and nearly choked on
his bonbon.  `Well, Case, all I can say to that, and I really
don't have nearly as many answers as you imagine I do, is that
what you think of as Wintermute is only a part of another, a,
shall we say, _potential_ entity.  I, let us say, am merely one
aspect of that entity's brain.  It's rather like dealing, from your
point of view, with a man whose lobes have been severed.  Let's
say you're dealing with a small part of the man's left brain. 
Difficult to say if you're dealing with the man at all, in a case
like that.'  Deane smiled.
  `Is the Corto story true?  You got to him through a micro
in that French hospital?'
  `Yes.  And I assembled the file you accessed in London.  I
try to plan, in your sense of the word, but that isn't my basic
mode, really.  I improvise.  It's my greatest talent.  I prefer
situations to plans, you see...  Really, I've had to deal with
givens.  I can sort a great deal of information, and sort it very
quickly.  It's taken a very long time to assemble the team you're
a part of.  Corto was the first, and he very nearly didn't make
it.  Very far gone, in Toulon.  Eating, excreting, and mastur-
bating were the best he could manage.  But the underlying
structure of obsessions was there: Screaming Fist, his betrayal,
the Congressional hearings.'
  `Is he still crazy?'
  `He's not quite a personality.'  Deane smiled.  `But I'm sure
you're aware of that.  But Corto is in there, somewhere, and I
can no longer maintain that delicate balance.  He's going to
come apart on you, Case.  So I'll be counting on you...'
  `That's good, motherfucker,' Case said, and shot him in
the mouth with the .357.
  He'd been right about the brains.  And the blood.

  `Mon,' Maelcum was saying, `I don't like this...'
  `It's cool,' Molly said.  `It's just okay.  It's something these
guys do, is all.  Like, he wasn't dead, and it was only a few
seconds...'
  `I saw th'~ screen, EEG readin'~ dead.  Nothin'~ movin'~, forty
second.'
  `Well, he's okay now.'
  `EEG flat as a _strap,'_ Maelcum protested.



        10

  He was numb, as they went through customs, and Molly
did most of the talking.  Maelcum remained on board _Garvey._ 
Customs, for Freeside, consisted mainly of proving your credit. 
The first thing he saw, when they gained the inner surface of
the spindle, was a branch of the Beautiful Girl coffee franchise.
  `Welcome to the Rue Jules Verne,' Molly said.  `If you
have trouble walking, just look at your feet.  The perspective's
a bitch, if you're not used to it.'
  They were standing in a broad street that seemed to be the
floor of a deep slot or canyon, its either end concealed by subtle
angles in the shops and buildings that formed its walls.  The
light, here, was filtered through fresh green masses of vege-
tation tumbling from overhanging tiers and balconies that rose
above them.  The sun...
  There was a brilliant slash of white somewhere above them,
too bright, and the recorded blue of a Cannes sky.  He knew
that sunlight was pumped in with a Lado-Acheson system whose
two-millimeter armature ran the length of the spindle, that they
generated a rotating library of sky effects around it, that if the
sky were turned off, he'd stare up past the armature of light
to the curves of lakes, rooftops of casinos, other streets... 
But it made no sense to his body.
  `Jesus,' he said, `I like this less than SAS.'
  `Get used to it.  I was a gambler's bodyguard here for a
month.'
  `Wanna go somewhere, lie down.'
  `Okay.  I got our keys.'  She touched his shoulder.  `What
happened to you, back there, man?  You flatlined.'
  He shook his head.  `I dunno, yet.  Wait.'
  `Okay.  We get a cab or something.'  She took his hand and
led him across Jules Verne, past a window displaying the sea-
son's Paris furs.
  `Unreal,' he said, looking up again.
  `Nah,' she responded, assuming he meant the furs, `grow
it on a collagen base, but it's mink DNA.  What's it matter?'

  `It's just a big tube and they pour things through it,' Molly
said.  `Tourists, hustlers, anything.  And there's fine mesh money
screens working every minute, make sure the money stays here
when the people fall back down the well.'
  Armitage had booked them into a place called the Inter-
continental, a sloping glass-fronted cliff face that slid down
into cold mist and the sound of rapids.  Case went out onto
their balcony and watched a trio of tanned French teenagers
ride simple hang gliders a few meters above the spray, triangles
of nylon in bright primary colors.  One of them swung, banked,
and Case caught a flash of cropped dark hair, brown breasts,
white teeth in a wide smile.  The air here smelled of running
water and flowers.  `Yeah,' he said, `lotta money.'
  She leaned beside him against the railing, her hands loose
and relaxed.  `Yeah.  We were gonna come here once, either
here or some place in Europe.'
  `We who?'
  `Nobody,' she said, giving her shoulders an involuntary
toss.  `You said you wanted to hit the bed.  Sleep.  I could use
some sleep.'
  `Yeah,' Case said, rubbing his palms across his cheek-
bones.  `Yeah, this is some place.'
  The narrow band of the Lado-Acheson system smoldered
in abstract imitation of some Bermudan sunset, striped by shreds
of recorded cloud.  `Yeah,' he said, `sleep.'
  Sleep wouldn't come.  When it did, it brought dreams that
were like neatly edited segments of memory.  He woke re-
peatedly, Molly curled beside him, and heard the water, voices
drifting in through the open glass panels of the balcony, a
woman's laughter from the stepped condos on the opposite
slope.  Deane's death kept turning up like a bad card, no matter
if he told himself that it hadn't been Deane.  That it hadn't, in
fact, happened at all.  Someone had once told him that the
amount of blood in the average human body was roughly equiv-
alent to a case of beer.
  Each time the image of Deane's shattered head struck the
rear wall of the office, Case was aware of another thought,
something darker, hidden, that rolled away, diving like a fish,
just beyond his reach.
  Linda.
  Deane.  Blood on the wall of the importer's office.
  Linda.  Smell of burnt flesh in the shadows of the Chiba
dome.  Molly holding out a bag of ginger, the plastic filmed
with blood.  Deane had had her killed.
  Wintermute.  He imagined a little micro whispering to the
wreck of a man named Corto, the words flowing like a river,
the flat personality-substitute called Armitage accreting slowly
in some darkened ward...  The Deane analog had said it
worked with givens, took advantage of existing situations.
  But what if Deane, the real Deane, had ordered Linda killed
on Wintermute's orders?  Case groped in the dark for a cigarette
and Molly's lighter.  There was no reason to suspect Deane, he
told himself, lighting up.  No reason.
  Wintermute could build a kind of personality into a shell. 
How subtle a form could manipulation take?  He stubbed the
Yeheyuan out in a bedside ashtray after his third puff, rolled
away from Molly, and tried to sleep.
  The dream, the memory, unreeled with the monotony of an
unedited simstim tape.  He'd spent a month, his fifteenth sum-
mer, in a weekly rates hotel, fifth floor, with a girl called
Marlene.  The elevator hadn't worked in a decade.  Roaches
boiled across grayish porcelain in the drain-plugged kitchenette
when you flicked a lightswitch.  He slept with Marlene on a
striped mattress with no sheets.
  He'd missed the first wasp, when it built its paperfine gray
house on the blistered paint of the windowframe, but soon the
nest was a fist-sized lump of fiber, insects hurtling out to hunt
the alley below like miniature copters buzzing the rotting con-
tents of the dumpsters.
  They'd each had a dozen beers, the afternoon a wasp stung
Marlene.  `Kill the fuckers,' she said, her eyes dull with rage
and the still heat of the room, `burn 'em.'  Drunk, Case rum-
maged in the sour closet for Rollo's dragon.  Rollo was Mar-
lene's previous -- and, Case suspected at the time, still
occasional -- boyfriend, an enormous Frisco biker with a blond
lightning bolt bleached into his dark crewcut.  The dragon was
a Frisco flamethrower, a thing like a fat anglehead flashlight. 
Case checked the batteries, shook it to make sure he had enough
fuel, and went to the open window.  The hive began to buzz.
  The air in the Sprawl was dead, immobile.  A wasp shot
from the nest and circled Case's head.  Case pressed the ignition
switch, counted three, and pulled the trigger.  The fuel, pumped
up to 100 psi, sprayed out past the white-hot coil.  A five-meter
tongue of pale fire, the nest charring, tumbling.  Across the
alley, someone cheered.
  `Shit!'  Marlene behind him, swaying.  `Stupid!  You didn't
burn 'em.  You just knocked it off.  They'll come up here and
kill us!'  Her voice sawing at his nerves, he imagined her en-
gulfed in flame, her bleached hair sizzling a special green.
  In the alley, the dragon in hand, he approached the black-
ened nest.  It had broken open.  Singed wasps wrenched and
flipped on the asphalt.
  He saw the thing the shell of gray paper had concealed.
  Horror.  The spiral birth factory, stepped terraces of the
hatching cells, blind jaws of the unborn moving ceaselessly,
the staged progress from egg to larva, near-wasp, wasp.  In his
mind's eye, a kind of time-lapse photography took place, re-
vealing the thing as the biological equivalent of a machine gun,
hideous in its perfection.  Alien.  He pulled the trigger, forgetting
to press the ignition, and fuel hissed over the bulging, writhing
life at his feet.
  When he did hit the ignition, it exploded with a thump,
taking an eyebrow with it.  Five floors above him, from the
open window, he heard Marlene laughing.
  He woke with the impression of light fading, but the room
was dark.  Afterimages, retinal flares.  The sky outside hinted
at the start of a recorded dawn.  There were no voices now,
only the rush of water, far down the face of the Intercontinental.
  In the dream, just before he'd drenched the nest with fuel,
he'd seen the T-A logo of Tessier-Ashpool neatly embossed
into its side, as though the wasps themselves had worked it
there.

  Molly insisted on coating him with bronzer, saying his Sprawl
pallor would attract too much attention.
  `Christ,' he said, standing naked in front of the mirror,
`you think that looks real?'  She was using the last of the tube
on his left ankle, kneeling beside him.
  `Nah, but it looks like you care enough to fake it.  There. 
There isn't enough to do your foot.'  She stood, tossing the
empty tube into a large wicker basket.  Nothing in the room
looked as though it had been machine-made or produced from
synthetics.  Expensive, Case knew, but it was a style that had
always irritated him.  The temperfoam of the huge bed was
tinted to resemble sand.  There was a lot of pale wood and
handwoven fabric.
  `What about you,' he said, `you gonna dye yourself brown? 
Don't exactly look like you spend all your time sunbathing.'
  She wore loose black silks and black espadrilles.  `I'm an
exotic.  I got a big straw hat for this, too.  You, you just wanna
look like a cheap-ass hood who's up for what he can get, so
the instant tan's okay.'
  Case regarded his pallid foot morosely, then looked at him-
self in the mirror.  `Christ.  You mind if I get dressed now?' 
He went to the bed and began to pull his jeans on.  `You sleep
okay?  You notice any lights?'
  `You were dreaming,' she said.
  They had breakfast on the roof of the hotel, a kind of meadow,
studded with striped umbrellas and what seemed to Case an
unnatural number of trees.  He told her about his attempt to
buzz the Berne AI.  The whole question of bugging seemed to
have become academic.  If Armitage were tapping them, he'd
be doing it through Wintermute.
  `And it was like real?' she asked, her mouth full of cheese
croissant.  `Like simstim?'
  He said it was.  `Real as this,' he added, looking around. 
`Maybe more.'
  The trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of
genetic engineering and chemical manipulation.  Case would
have been hard pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but
a street boy's sense of style told him that these were too cute,
too entirely and definitively treelike.  Between the trees, on
gentle and too cleverly irregular slopes of sweet green grass,
the bright umbrellas shaded the hotel's guests from the unfal-
tering radiance of the Lado-Acheson sun.  A burst of French
from a nearby table caught his attention: the golden children
he'd seen gliding above river mist the evening before.  Now he
saw that their tans were uneven, a stencil effect produced by
selective melanin boosting, multiple shades overlapping in rec-
tilinear patterns, outlining and highlighting musculature, the
girl's small hard breasts, one boy's wrist resting on the white
enamel of the table.  They looked to Case like machines built
for racing; they deserved decals for their hairdressers, the de-
signers of their white cotton ducks, for the artisans who'd
crafted their leather sandals and simple jewelry.  Beyond them,
at another table, three Japanese wives in Hiroshima sackcloth
awaited sarariman husbands, their oval faces covered with ar-
tificial bruises; it was, he knew, an extremely conservative
style, one he'd seldom seen in Chiba.
  `What's that smell?' he asked Molly, wrinkling his nose.
  `The grass.  Smells that way after they cut it.'
  Armitage and Riviera arrived as they were finishing their
coffee, Armitage in tailored khakis that made him look as
though his regimental patches had just been stripped, Riviera
in a loose gray seersucker outfit that perversely suggested prison.
  `Molly, love,' Riviera said, almost before he was settled
on his chair, `you'll have to dole me out more of the medicine. 
I'm out.'
  `Peter,' she said, `and what if I won't?'  She smiled without
showing her teeth.
  `You will,' Riviera said, his eyes cutting to Armitage and
back.
  `Give it to him,' Armitage said.
  `Pig for it, aren't you?'  She took a flat, foil-wrapped packet
from an inside pocket and flipped it across the table.  Riviera
caught it in midair.  `He could off himself,' she said to Ar-
mitage.
  `I have an audition this afternoon,' Riviera said.  `I'll need
to be at my best.'  He cupped the foil packet in his upturned
palm and smiled.  Small glittering insects swarmed out of it,
vanished.  He dropped it into the pocket of his seersucker blouse.
  `You've got an audition yourself, Case, this afternoon,'
Armitage said.  `On that tug.  I want you to get over to the pro
shop and get yourself fitted for a vac suit, get checked out on
it, and get out to the boat.  You've got about three hours.'
  `How come we get shipped over in a shitcan and you two
hire a _JAL_ taxi?' Case asked, deliberately avoiding the man's
eyes.
  `Zion suggested we use it.  Good cover, when we move.  I
do have a larger boat, standing by, but the tug is a nice touch.'
  `How about me?' Molly asked.  `I got chores today?'
  `I want you to hike up the far end to the axis, work out in
zero-g.  Tomorrow, maybe, you can hike in the opposite di-
rection.'  Straylight, Case thought.
  `How soon?' Case asked, meeting the pale stare.
  `Soon,' Armitage said.  `Get going, Case.'

  `Mon, you doin'~ jus'~ fine,' Maelcum said, helping Case
out of the red Sanyo vacuum suit.  `Aerol say you doin'~ jus'~
fine.'  Aerol had been waiting at one of the sporting docks at
the end of the spindle, near the weightless axis.  To reach it,
Case had taken an elevator down to the hull and ridden a
miniature induction train.  As the diameter of the spindle nar-
rowed, gravity decreased; somewhere above him, he'd decided,
would be the mountains Molly climbed, the bicycle loop,
launching gear for the hang gliders and miniature microlights.
  Aerol had ferried him out to _Marcus Garvey_ in a skeletal
scooter frame with a chemical engine.
  `Two hour ago,' Maelcum said, `I take delivery of Babylon
goods for you; nice Japan-boy inna yacht, mos'~ pretty yacht.'
  Free of the suit, Case pulled himself gingerly over the Ho-
saka and fumbled into the straps of the web.  `Well,' he said,
`let's see it.'
  Maelcum produced a white lump of foam slightly smaller
than Case's head, fished a pearl-handled switchblade on a green
nylon lanyard out of the hip pocket of his tattered shorts and
carefully slit the plastic.  He extracted a rectangular object and
passed it to Case.  `Thas part some gun, mon?'
  `No,' Case said, turning it over, `but it's a weapon.  It's
virus.'
  `Not on _this_ boy tug, mon,' Maelcum said firmly, reaching
for the steel cassette.
  `A program.  Virus program.  Can't get into you, can't even
get into your software.  I've got to interface it through the deck,
before it can work on anything.'
  `Well.  Japan-mon, he says Hosaka here'll tell you every
what an'~ wherefore, you wanna know.'
  `Okay.  Well, you leave me to it, okay?'
  Maelcum kicked off and drifted past the pilot console, bus-
ying himself with a caulk gun.  Case hastily looked away from
the waving fronds of transparent caulk.  He wasn't sure why,
but something about them brought back the nausea of SAS.
  `What is this thing?' he asked the Hosaka.  `Parcel for me.'
  `Data transfer from Bockris Systems GmbH, Frankfurt, ad-
vises, under coded transmission, that content of shipment is
Kuang Grade Mark Eleven penetration program.  Bockris fur-
ther advises that interface with Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7 is
entirely compatible and yields optimal penetration capabilities,
particularly with regard to existing military systems...'
  `How about an AI?'
  `Existing military systems and artificial intelligences.'
  `Jesus Christ.  What did you call it?'
  `Kuang Grade Mark Eleven.'
  `It's Chinese?'
  `Yes.'
  `Off.'  Case fastened the virus cassette to the side of the
Hosaka with a length of silver tape, remembering Molly's story
of her day in Macao.  Armitage had crossed the border into
Zhongshan.  `On,' he said, changing his mind.  `Question.  Who
owns Bockris, the people in Frankfurt?'
  `Delay for interorbital transmission,' said the Hosaka.
  `Code it.  Standard commercial code.'
  `Done.'
  He drummed his hands on the Ono-Sendai.
  `Reinhold Scientific A.G., Berne.'
  `Do it again.  Who owns Reinhold?'
  It took three more jumps up the ladder before he reached
Tessier-Ashpool.
  `Dixie,' he said, jacking in, `what do you know about
Chinese virus programs?'
  `Not a whole hell of a lot.'
  `Ever hear of a grading system like Kuang, Mark Eleven?'
  `No.'
  Case sighed.  `Well, I got a user-friendly Chinese icebreaker
here, a one shot cassette.  Some people in Frankfurt say it'll
cut an AI.'
  `Possible.  Sure.  If it's military.'
  `Looks like it.  Listen, Dix, and gimme the benefit of your
background, okay?  Armitage seems to be setting up a run on
an AI that belongs to Tessier-Ashpool.  The mainframe's in
Berne, but it's linked with another one in Rio.  The one in Rio
is the one that flatlined you, that first time.  So it looks like
they link via Straylight, the T-A home base, down the end of
the spindle, and we're supposed to cut our way in with the
Chinese icebreaker.  So if Wintermute's backing the whole show,
it's paying us to burn it.  It's burning itself.  And something that
calls itself Wintermute is trying to get on my good side, get
me to maybe shaft Armitage.  What goes?'
  `Motive,' the construct said.  `Real motive problem, with
an AI.  Not human, see?'
  `Well, yeah, obviously.'
  `Nope.  I mean, it's not human.  And you can't get a handle
on it.  Me, I'm not human either, but I _respond_ like one.  See?'
  `Wait a sec,' Case said.  `Are you sentient, or not?'
  `Well, it _feels_ like I am, kid, but I'm really just a bunch of
ROM.  It's one of them, ah, philosophical questions, I guess...' 
The ugly laughter sensation rattled down Case's spine.  `But I
ain't likely to write you no poem, if you follow me.  Your AI,
it just might.  But it ain't no way _human.'_
  `So you figure we can't get on to its motive?'
  `It own itself?'
  `Swiss citizen, but T-A own the basic software and the
mainframe.'
  `That's a good one,' the construct said.  `Like, I own your
brain and what you know, but your thoughts have Swiss citi-
zenship.  Sure.  Lotsa luck, AI.'
  `So it's getting ready to burn itself?'  Case began to punch
the deck nervously, at random.  The matrix blurred, resolved,
and he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim
steel combine.
  `Autonomy, that's the bugaboo, where your AI's are con-
cerned.  My guess, Case, you're going in there to cut the hard-
wired shackles that keep this baby from getting any smarter. 
And I can't see how you'd distinguish, say, between a move
the parent company makes, and some move the AI makes on
its own, so that's maybe where the confusion comes in.'  Again
the nonlaugh.  `See, those things, they can work real hard, buy
themselves time to write cookbooks or whatever, but the min-
ute, I mean the nanosecond, that one starts figuring out ways
to make itself smarter, Turing'll wipe it.  _Nobody_ trusts those
fuckers, you know that.  Every AI ever built has an electro-
magnetic shotgun wired to its forehead.'
  Case glared at the pink spheres of Sikkim.
  `Okay,' he said, finally, `I'm slotting this virus.  I want you
to scan its instruction face and tell me what you think.'
  The half sense of someone reading over his shoulder was
gone for a few seconds, then returned.  `Hot shit.  Case.  It's a
slow virus.  Take six hours, estimated, to crack a military target.'
  `Or an AI.'  He sighed.  `Can we run it?'
  `Sure,' the construct said, `unless you got a morbid fear
of dying.'
  `Sometimes you repeat yourself, man.'
  `It's my nature.'

  Molly was sleeping when he returned to the Intercontinental. 
He sat on the balcony and watched a microlight with rainbow
polymer wings as it soared up the curve of Freeside, its tri-
angular shadow tracking across meadows and rooftops, until
it vanished behind the band of the Lado-Acheson system.
  `I wanna buzz,' he said to the blue artifice of the sky.  `I
truly do wanna get high, you know?  Trick pancreas, plugs in
my liver, little bags of shit melting, fuck it all.  I wanna buzz.'
  He left without waking Molly, he thought.  He was never
sure, with the glasses.  He shrugged tension from his shoulders
and got into the elevator.  He rode up with an Italian girl in
spotless whites, cheekbones and nose daubed with something
black and nonreflective.  Her white nylon shoes had steel cleats;
the expensive-looking thing in her hand resembled a cross be-
tween a miniature oar and an orthopedic brace.  She was off
for a fast game of something, but Case had no idea what.
  On the roof meadow, he made his way through the grove
of trees and umbrellas, until he found a pool, naked bodies
gleaming against turquoise tiles.  He edged into the shadow of
an awning and pressed his chip against a dark glass plate. 
`Sushi,' he said, `whatever you got.'  Ten minutes later, an
enthusiastic Chinese waiter arrived with his food.  He munched
raw tuna and rice and watched people tan.  `Christ,' he said,
to his tuna, `I'd go nuts.'
  `Don't tell me,' someone said, `I know it already.  You're
a gangster, right?'
  He squinted up at her, against the band of sun.  A long young
body and a melanin-boosted tan, but not one of the Paris jobs.
  She squatted beside his chair, dripping water on the tiles. 
`Cath,' she said.
  `Lupus,' after a pause.
  `What kind of name is that?'
  `Greek,' he said.
  `Are you really a gangster?'  The melanin boost hadn't pre-
vented the formation of freckles.
  `I'm a drug addict, Cath.'
  `What kind?'
  `Stimulants.  Central nervous system stimulants.  Extremely
powerful central nervous system stimulants.'
  `Well, do you _have_ any?'  She leaned closer.  Drops of
chlorinated water fell on the leg of his pants.
  `No.  That's my problem, Cath.  Do you know where we
can get some?'
  Cath rocked back on her tanned heels and licked at a strand
of brownish hair that had pasted itself beside her mouth.  `What's
your taste?'
  `No coke, no amphetamines, but _up,_ gotta be _up.'_  And so
much for that, he thought glumly, holding his smile for her.
  `Betaphenethylamine,' she said.  `No sweat, but it's on your
chip.'

  `You're kidding,' said Cath's partner and roommate, when
Case explained the peculiar properties of his Chiba pancreas. 
`I mean, can't you sue them or something?  Malpractice?'  His
name was Bruce.  He looked like a gender switch version of
Cath, right down to the freckles.
  `Well,' Case said, `it's just one of those things, you know? 
Like tissue matching and all that.'  But Bruce's eyes had already
gone numb with boredom.  Got the attention span of a gnat,
Case thought, watching the boy's brown eyes.
  Their room was smaller than the one Case shared with Molly,
and on another level, closer to the surface.  Five huge Ciba-
chromes of Tally Isham were taped across the glass of the
balcony, suggesting an extended residency.
  `They're def triff, huh?' Cath asked seeing him eye the
transparencies.  `Mine.  Shot 'em at the S/N Pyramid, last time
we went down the well.  She was _that_ close, and she just smiled,
_so_ natural.  And it was _bad_ there, Lupus, day after these Christ
the King terrs put angel in the water, you know?'
  `Yeah,' Case said, suddenly uneasy, `terrible thing.'
  `Well,' Bruce cut in, `about this beta you want to buy...'
  `Thing is, can I metabolize it?'  Case raised his eyebrows.
  `Tell you what,' the boy said.  `You do a taste.  If you
pancreas passes on it, it's on the house.  First time's free.'
  `I heard that one before,' Case said, taking the bright blue
derm that Bruce passed across the black bedspread.

  `Case?'  Molly sat up in bed and shook the hair away from
her lenses.
  `Who else, honey?'
  `What's got into you?'  The mirrors followed him across
the room.
  `I forget how to pronounce it,' he said, taking a tighty
rolled strip of bubble-packed blue derms from his shirt pocket.
  `Christ,' she said, `just what we needed.'
  `Truer words were never spoken.'
  `I let you out of my sight for two hours and you score.' 
She shook her head.  `I hope you're gonna be ready for our
big dinner date with Armitage tonight.  This Twentieth Century
place.  We get to watch Riviera strut his stuff, too.'
  `Yeah,' Case said, arching his back, his smile locked into
a rictus of delight, `beautiful.'
  `Man,' she said, `if whatever that is can get in past what
those surgeons did to you in Chiba, you are gonna be in sad- 
ass shape when it wears off.'
  `Bitch, bitch, bitch,' he said, unbuckling his belt.  `Doom. 
Gloom.  All I ever hear.'  He took his pants off, his shirt, his
underwear.  `I think you oughta have sense enough to take
advantage of my unnatural state.'  He looked down.  `I mean,
_look_ at this unnatural state.'
  She laughed.  `It won't last.'
  `But it will,' he said, climbing into the sand-colored tem-
perfoam, `that's what's so _unnatural_ about it.'



        11

  `Case, what's wrong with you?' Armitage said, as the waiter
was seating them at his table in the Vingtime Sicle.  It was
the smallest and most expensive of several floating restaurants
on a small lake near the Intercontinental.
  Case shuddered.  Bruce hadn't said anything about after ef-
fects.  He tried to pick up a glass of ice water, but his hands
were shaking.  `Something I ate, maybe.'
  `I want you checked out by a medic,' Armitage said.
  `Just this hystamine reaction,' Case lied.  `Get it when I
travel, eat different stuff, sometimes.'
  Armitage wore a dark suit, too formal for the place, and a
white silk shirt.  His gold bracelet rattled as he raised his wine
and sipped.  `I've ordered for you,' he said.
  Molly and Armitage ate in silence, while Case sawed shakily
at his steak, reducing it to uneaten bite-sized fragments, which
he pushed around in the rich sauce, finally abandoning the
whole thing.
  `Jesus,' Molly said, her own plate empty, `gimme that. 
You know what this costs?'  She took his plate.  `They gotta
raise a whole animal for years and then they kill it.  This isn't
vat stuff.'  She forked a mouthful up and chewed.
  `Not hungry,' Case managed.  His brain was deep-fried. 
No, he decided, it had been thrown into hot fat and left there,
and the fat had cooled, a thick dull grease congealing on the
wrinkled lobes, shot through with greenish-purple flashes of
pain.
  `You look fucking awful,' Molly said cheerfully.
  Case tried the wine.  The aftermath of the betaphenethylam-
ine made it taste like iodine.
  The lights dimmed.
  `Le Restaurant Vingtime Sicle,' said a disembodied voice
with a pronounced Sprawl accent, `proudly presents the hol-
ographic cabaret of Mr.~ Peter Riviera.'  Scattered applause from
the other tables.  A waiter lit a single candle and placed it in
the center of their table, then began to remove the dishes.  Soon
a candle flickered at each of the restaurant's dozen tables, and
drinks were being poured.
  `What's happening?' Case asked Armitage, who said noth-
ing.
  Molly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail.
  `Good evening,' Riviera said, stepping forward on a small
stage at the far end of the room.  Case blinked.  In his discomfort,
he hadn't noticed the stage.  He hadn't seen where Riviera had
come from.  His uneasiness increased.
  At first he assumed the man was illuminated by a spotlight.
  Riviera glowed.  The light clung around him like a skin, lit
the dark hangings behind the stage.  He was projecting.
  Riviera smiled.  He wore a white dinner jacket.  On his lapel,
blue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation.  His fin-
gernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting,
an embrace for his audience.  Case heard the shallow water lap
against the side of the restaurant.
  `Tonight,' Riviera said, his long eyes shining, `I would
like to perform an extended piece for you.  A new work.'  A
cool ruby of light formed in the palm of his upraised right hand. 
He dropped it.  A gray dove fluttered up from the point of
impact and vanished into the shadows.  Someone whistled.  More
applause.
  `The title of the work is `The Doll.''  Riviera lowered his
hands.  `I wish to dedicate its premiere here, tonight, to Lady
3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool.'  A wave of polite ap-
plause.  As it died, Riviera's eyes seemed to find their table. 
`And to another lady.'
  The restaurant's lights died entirely, for a few seconds,
leaving only the glow of candles.  Riviera's holographic aura
had faded with the lights, but Case could still see him, standing
with his head bowed.
  Lines of faint light began to form, verticals and horizontals,
sketching an open cube around the stage.  The restaurant's lights
had come back up slightly, but the framework surrounding the
stage might have been constructed of frozen moonbeams.  Head
bowed, eyes closed, arms rigid at his sides, Riviera seemed to
quiver with concentration.  Suddenly the ghostly cube was filled,
had become a room, a room lacking its fourth wall, allowing
the audience to view its contents.
  Riviera seemed to relax slightly.  He raised his head, but
kept his eyes closed.  `I'd always lived in the room,' he said. 
`I couldn't remember ever having lived in any other room.' 
The room's walls were yellowed white plaster.  It contained
two pieces of furniture.  One was a plain wooden chair, the
other an iron bedstead painted white.  The paint had chipped
and flaked, revealing the black iron.  The mattress on the bed
was bare.  Stained ticking with faded brown stripes.  A single
bulb dangled above the bed on a twisted length of black wire. 
Case could see the thick coating of dust on the bulb's upper
curve.  Riviera opened his eyes.
  `I'd been alone in the room, always.'  He sat on the chair,
facing the bed.  The blue coals still burned in the black flower
on his lapel.  `I don't know when I first began to dream of
her,' he said, `but I do remember that at first she was only a
haze, a shadow.'
  There was something on the bed.  Case blinked.  Gone.
  `I couldn't quite hold her, hold her in my mind.  But I wanted
to hold her, hold her and more...'  His voice carried perfectly
in the hush of the restaurant.  Ice clicked against the side of a
glass.  Someone giggled.  Someone else asked a whispered ques-
tion in Japanese.  `I decided that if I could visualize some part
of her, only a small part, if I could see that part perfectly, in
the most perfect detail...'
  A woman's hand lay on the mattress now, palm up, the
white fingers pale.
  Riviera leaned forward, picked up the hand, and began to
stroke it gently.  The fingers moved.  Riviera raised the hand to
his mouth and began to lick the tips of the fingers.  The nails
were coated with a burgundy lacquer.
  A hand, Case saw, but not a severed hand; the skin swept
back smoothly, unbroken and unscarred.  He remembered a
tattooed lozenge of vatgrown flesh in the window of a Ninsei
surgical boutique.  Riviera was holding the hand to his lips,
licking its palm.  The fingers tentatively caressed his face.  But
now a second hand lay on the bed.  When Riviera reached for
it, the fingers of the first were locked around his wrist, a bracelet
of flesh and bone.
  The act progressed with a surreal internal logic of its own. 
The arms were next.  Feet.  Legs.  The legs were very beautiful. 
Case's head throbbed.  His throat was dry.  He drank the last
of the wine.
  Riviera was in the bed now, naked.  His clothing had been
a part of the projection, but Case couldn't remember seeing it
fade away.  The black flower lay at the foot of the bed, still
seething with its blue inner flame.  Then the torso formed, as
Riviera caressed it into being, white, headless, and perfect,
sheened with the faintest gloss of sweat.
  Molly's body.  Case stared, his mouth open.  But it wasn't
Molly; it was Molly as Riviera imagined her.  The breasts were
wrong, the nipples larger, too dark.  Riviera and the limbless
torso writhed together on the bed, crawled over by the hands
with their bright nails.  The bed was thick now with folds of
yellowed, rotting lace that crumbled at a touch.  Motes of dust
boiled around Riviera and the twitching limbs, the scurrying,
pinching, caressing hands.
  Case glanced at Molly.  Her face was blank; the colors of
Riviera's projection heaved and turned in her mirrors.  Armitage
was leaning forward, his hands round the stem of a wineglass,
his pale eyes fixed on the stage, the glowing room.
  Now limbs and torso had merged, and Riviera shuddered. 
The head was there, the image complete.  Molly's face, with
smooth quicksilver drowning the eyes.  Riviera and the Molly- 
image began to couple with a renewed intensity.  Then the image
slowly extended a clawed hand and extruded its five blades. 
With a languorous, dreamlike deliberation, it raked Riviera's
bare back.  Case caught a glimpse of exposed spine, but he was
already up and stumbling for the door.
  He vomited over a rosewood railing into the quiet waters
of the lake.  Something that had seemed to close around his
head like a vise had released him now.  Kneeling, his cheek
against the cool wood, he stared across the shallow lake at the
bright aura of the Rue Jules Verne.
  Case had seen the medium before; when he'd been a teenager
in the Sprawl, they'd called it, `dreaming real.'  He remem-
bered thin Puerto Ricans under East Side streetlights, dreaming
real to the quick beat of a salsa, dreamgirls shuddering and
turning, the onlookers clapping in time.  But that had needed
a van full of gear and a clumsy trode helmet.
  What Riviera dreamed, you got.  Case shook his aching head
and spat into the lake.
  He could guess the end, the finale.  There was an inverted
symmetry: Riviera puts the dreamgirl together, the dreamgirl
takes him apart.  With those hands.  Dreamblood soaking the
rotten lace.
  Cheers from the restaurant, applause.  Case stood and ran
his hands over his clothes.  He turned and walked back into the
Vingtime Sicle.
  Molly's chair was empty.  The stage was deserted.  Armitage
sat alone, still staring at the stage, the stem of the wineglass
between his fingers.
  `Where is she?' Case asked.
  `Gone,' Armitage said.
  `She go after him?'
  `No.'  There was a soft _tink._  Armitage looked down at the
glass.  His left hand came up holding the bulb of glass with its
measure of red wine.  The broken stem protruded like a sliver
of ice.  Case took it from him and set it in a water glass.
  `Tell me where she went, Armitage.'
  The lights came up.  Case looked into the pale eyes.  Nothing
there at all.  `She's gone to prepare herself.  You won't see her
again.  You'll be together during the run.'
  `Why did Riviera do that to her?'
  Armitage stood, adjusting the lapels of his jacket.  `Get some
sleep, Case.'
  `We run, tomorrow?'
  Armitage smiled his meaningless smile and walked away,
toward the exit.
  Case rubbed his forehead and looked around the room.  The
diners were rising, women smiling as men made jokes.  He
noticed the balcony for the first time, candles still flickering
there in private darkness.  He heard the clink of silverware,
muted conversation.  The candles threw dancing shadows on
the ceiling.
  The girl's face appeared as abruptly as one of Riviera's
projections, her small hands on the polished wood of the bal-
ustrade; she leaned forward, face rapt, it seemed to him, her
dark eyes intent on something beyond.  The stage.  It was a
striking face, but not beautiful.  Triangular, the cheekbones high
yet strangely fragile-looking, mouth wide and firm, balanced
oddly by a narrow, avian nose with flaring nostrils.  And then
she was gone, back into private laughter and the dance of
candles.
  As he left the restaurant, he noticed the two young French-
men and their girlfriend, who were waiting for the boat to the
far shore and the nearest casino.

  Their room was silent, the temperfoam smooth as some
beach after a retreating tide.  Her bag was gone.  He looked for
a note.  There was nothing.  Several seconds passed before the
scene beyond the window registered through his tension and
unhappiness.  He looked up and saw a view of Desiderata,
expensive shops: Gucci, Tsuyako, Hermes, Liberty.
  He stared, then shook his head and crossed to a panel he
hadn't bothered examining.  He turned the hologram off and
was rewarded with the condos that terraced the far slope.
  He picked up the phone and carried it out to the cool balcony.
  `Get me a number for the _Marcus Garvey,'_ he told the
desk.  `It's a tug, registered out of Zion cluster.'
  The chip voice recited a ten-digit number.  `Sir,' it added,
`the registration in question is Panamanian.'
  Maelcum answered on the fifth tone.  `Yo?'
  `Case.  You got a modem, Maelcum?'
  `Yo.  On th'~ navigation comp, ya know.'
  `Can you get it off for me, man?  Put it on my Hosaka. 
Then turn my deck on.  It's the stud with the ridges on it.'
  `How you doin'~ in there, mon?'
  `Well, I need some help.'
  `Movin'~, mon.  I get th'~ modem.'
  Case listened to faint static while Maelcum attached the
simple phone link.  `Ice this,' he told the Hosaka, when he
heard it beep.
  `You are speaking from a heavily monitored location,' the
computer advised primly.
  `Fuck it,' he said.  `Forget the ice.  No ice.  Access the
construct.  Dixie?'
  `Hey, Case.'  The Flatline spoke through the Hosaka's voice
chip, the carefully engineered accent lost entirely.
  `Dix, you're about to punch your way in here and get
something for me.  You can be as blunt as you want.  Molly's
in here somewhere and I wanna know where.  I'm in 335W,
the Intercontinental.  She was registered here too, but I don't
know what name she was using.  Ride in on this phone and do
their records for me.'
  `No sooner said,' the Flatline said.  Case heard the white
sound of the invasion.  He smiled.  `Done.  Rose Kolodny. 
Checked out.  Take me a few minutes to screw their security
net deep enough to get a fix.'
  `Go.'
  The phone whined and clicked with the construct's efforts. 
Case carried it back into the room and put the receiver face up
on the temperfoam.  He went into the bathroom and brushed
his teeth.  As he was stepping back out, the monitor on the
room's Braun audiovisual complex lit up.  A Japanese pop star
reclining against metallic cushions.  An unseen interviewer asked
a question in German.  Case stared.  The screen jumped with
jags of blue interference.  `Case, baby, you lose your mind,
man?'  The voice was slow, familiar.
  The glass wall of the balcony clicked in with its view of
Desiderata, but the street scene blurred, twisted, became the
interior of the Jarre de Th, Chiba, empty, red neon replicated
to scratched infinity in the mirrored walls.
  Lonny Zone stepped forward, tall and cadaverous, moving
with the slow undersea grace of his addiction.  He stood alone
among the square tables, his hands in the pockets of his gray
sharkskin slacks.  `Really, man, you're lookin'~ very scattered.'
  The voice came from the Braun's speakers.
  `Wintermute,' Case said.
  The pimp shrugged languidly and smiled.
  `Where's Molly?'
  `Never you mind.  You're screwing up tonight, Case.  The
Flatline's ringing bells all over Freeside.  I didn't think you'd
do that, man.  It's outside the profile.'
  `So tell me where she is and I'll call him off.'
  Zone shook his head.
  `You can't keep too good track of your women, can you,
Case.  Keep losin'~ 'em, one way or another.'
  `I'll bring this thing down around your ears,' Case said.
  `No.  You aren't that kind, man.  I know that.  You know
something, Case?  I figure you've got it figured out that it was
me told Deane to off that little cunt of yours in Chiba.'
  `Don't,' Case said, taking an involuntary step toward the
window.
  `But I didn't.  What's it matter, though?  How much does it
really matter to Mr.~ Case?  Quit kidding yourself.  I know your
Linda, man.  I know all the Lindas.  Lindas are a generic product
in my line of work.  Know why she decided to rip you off? 
Love.  So you'd give a shit.  Love?  Wanna talk love?  She loved
you.  I know that.  For the little she was worth, she loved you. 
You couldn't handle it.  She's dead.'
  Case's fist glanced off the glass.
  `Don't fuck up the hands, man.  Soon you punch deck.'
  Zone vanished, replaced by Freeside night and the lights of
the condos.  The Braun shut off.
  From the bed, the phone bleated steadily.
  `Case?'  The Flatline was waiting.  `Where you been?  I got
it, but it isn't much.'  The construct rattled off an address. 
`Place had some weird ice around it for a nightclub.  That's all
I could get without leaving a calling card.'
  `Okay,' Case said.  `Tell the Hosaka to tell Maelcum to
disconnect the modem.  Thanks, Dix.'
  `A pleasure.'
  He sat on the bed for a long time, savoring the new thing,
the treasure.
  Rage.

  `Hey.  Lupus.  Hey, Cath, it's friend Lupus.'  Bruce stood
naked in his doorway, dripping wet, his pupils enormous.  `But
we're just having a shower.  You wanna wait?  Wanna shower?'
  `No.  Thanks.  I want some help.'  He pushed the boy's arm
aside and stepped into the room.
  `Hey, really, man, we're...'
  `Going to help me.  You're really glad to see me.  Because
we're friends, right?  Aren't we?'
  Bruce blinked.  `Sure.'
  Case recited the address the Flatline had given him.
  `I knew he was a gangster,' Cath called cheerfully from
the shower.
  `I gotta Honda trike,' Bruce said, grinning vacantly.
  `We go now,' Case said.

  `That level's the cubicles,' Bruce said, after asking Case
to repeat the address for the eighth time.  He climbed back into
the Honda.  Condensation dribbled from the hydrogen-cell ex-
haust as the red fiberglass chassis swayed on chromed shocks. 
`You be long?'
  `No saying.  But you'll wait.'
  `We'll wait, yeah.'  He scratched his bare chest.  `That last
part of the address, I think that's a cubicle.  Number forty- 
three.'
  `You expected, Lupus?'  Cath craned forward over Bruce's
shoulder and peered up.  The drive had dried her hair.
  `Not really,' Case said.  `That's a problem?'
  `Just go down to the lowest level and find your friend's
cubicle.  If they let you in, fine.  If they don't wanna see you...' 
She shrugged.
  Case turned and descended a spiral staircase of floral iron. 
Six turns and he'd reached a nightclub.  He paused and lit a
Yeheyuan looking over the tables.  Freeside suddenly made
sense to him.  Biz.  He could feel it humming in the air.  This
was it, the local action.  Not the high-gloss facade of the Rue
Jules Verne, but the real thing.  Commerce.  The dance.  The
crowd was mixed; maybe half were tourists, the other half
residents of the islands.
  `Downstairs,' he said to a passing waiter, `I want to go
downstairs.'  He showed his Freeside chip.  The man gestured
toward the rear of the club.
  He walked quickly past the crowded tables, hearing frag-
ments of half a dozen European languages as he passed.
  `I want a cubicle,' he said to the girl who sat at the low
desk, a terminal on her lap.  `Lower level.'  He handed her his
chip.
  `Gender preference?'  She passed the chip across a glass
plate on the face of the terminal.
  `Female,' he said automatically.
  `Number thirty-five.  Phone if it isn't satisfactory.  You can
access our special services display beforehand, if you like.' 
She smiled.  She returned his chip.
  An elevator slid open behind her.
  The corridor lights were blue.  Case stepped out of the el-
evator and chose a direction at random.  Numbered doors.  A
hush like the halls of an expensive clinic.
  He found his cubicle.  He'd been looking for Molly's, now,
confused, he raised his chip and placed it against a black sensor
set directly beneath the number plate.
  Magnetic locks.  The sound reminded him of Cheap Hotel.
  The girl sat up in bed and said something in German.  Her
eyes were soft and unblinking.  Automatic pilot.  A neural cut- 
out.  He backed out of the cubicle and closed the door.
  The door of forty-three was like all the others.  He hesitated. 
The silence of the hallway said that the cubicles were sound-
proof.  It was pointless to try the chip.  He rapped his knuckles
against enameled metal.  Nothing.  The door seemed to absorb
the sound.
  He placed his chip against the black plate.
  The bolts clicked.
  She seemed to hit him, somehow, before he'd actually got-
ten the door open.  He was on his knees, the steel door against
his back, the blades of her rigid thumbs quivering centimeters
from his eyes...
  `Jesus Christ,' she said, cuffing the side of his head as she
rose.  `You're an idiot to try that.  How the hell you open those
locks, Case?  Case?  You okay?'  She leaned over him.
  `Chip,' he said, struggling for breath.  Pain was spreading
from his chest.  She helped him up and shoved him into the
cubicle.
  `You bribe the help, upstairs?'
  He shook his head and fell across the bed.
  `Breathe in.  Count.  One, two, three, four.  Hold it.  Now
out.  Count.'
  He clutched his stomach.
  `You kicked me,' he managed.
  `Shoulda been lower.  I wanna be alone.  I'm meditating,
right?'  She sat beside him.  `And getting a briefing.'  She pointed
at a small monitor set into the wall opposite the bed.  `Win-
termute's telling me about Straylight.'
  `Where's the meat puppet?'
  `There isn't any.  That's the most expensive special service
of all.'  She stood up.  She wore her leather jeans and a loose
dark shirt.  `The run's tomorrow, Wintermute says.'
  `What was that all about, in the restaurant?  How come you
ran?'
  `'Cause, if I'd stayed, I might have killed Riviera.'
  `Why?'
  `What he did to me.  The show.'
  `I don't get it.'
  `This cost a lot,' she said, extending her right hand as
though it held an invisible fruit.  The five blades slid out, then
retracted smoothly.  `Costs to go to Chiba, costs to get the
surgery, costs to have them jack your nervous system up so
you'll have the reflexes to go with the gear...  You know how
I got the money, when I was starting out?  Here.  Not here, but
a place like it, in the Sprawl.  Joke, to start with, 'cause once
they plant the cut-out chip, it seems like free money.  Wake up
sore, sometimes, but that's it.  Renting the goods, is all.  You
aren't in, when it's all happening.  House has software for
whatever a customer wants to pay for...'  She cracked her
knuckles.  `Fine.  I was getting my money.  Trouble was, the
cut-out and the circuitry the Chiba clinics put in weren't com-
patible.  So the worktime started bleeding in, and I could re-
member it...  But it was just bad dreams, and not all bad.' 
She smiled.  `Then it started getting strange.'  She pulled his
cigarettes from his pocket and lit one.  `The house found out
what I was doing with the money.  I had the blades in, but the
fine neuromotor work would take another three trips.  No way
I was ready to give up puppet time.'  She inhaled, blew out a
stream of smoke, capping it with three perfect rings.  `So the
bastard who ran the place, he had some custom software cooked
up.  Berlin, that's the place for snuff, you know?  Big market
for mean kicks, Berlin.  I never knew who wrote the program
they switched me to, but it was based on all the classics.'
  `They knew you were picking up on this stuff?  That you
were conscious while you were working?'
  `I wasn't conscious.  It's like cyberspace, but blank.  Silver. 
It smells like rain...  You can see yourself orgasm, it's like
a little nova right out on the rim of space.  But I was starting
to _remember._  Like dreams, you know.  And they didn't tell me. 
They switched the software and started renting to specialty
markets.'
  She seemed to speak from a distance.  `And I knew, but I
kept quiet about it.  I needed the money.  The dreams got worse
and worse, and I'd tell myself that at least some of them _were_
just dreams, but by then I'd started to figure that the boss had
a whole little _clientele_ going for me.  Nothing's too good for
Molly, the boss says, and gives me this shit raise.'  She shook
her head.  `That prick was charging _eight_ times what he was
paying me, and he thought I didn't know.'
  `So what was he charging for?'
  `Bad dreams.  Real ones.  One night... one night, I'd just
come back from Chiba.'  She dropped the cigarette, ground it
out with her heel, and sat down, leaning against the wall. 
`Surgeons went way in, that trip.  Tricky.  They must have
disturbed the cut-out chip.  I came up.  I was into this routine
with a customer...'  She dug her fingers deep in the foam. 
`Senator, he was.  Knew his fat face right away.  We were both
covered with blood.  We weren't alone.  She was all...'  She
tugged at the temperfoam.  `Dead.  And that fat prick, he was
saying, `What's wrong.  What's wrong?'  'Cause we weren't
_finished_ yet...'
  She began to shake.
  `So I guess I gave the Senator what he really wanted, you
know?'  The shaking stopped.  She released the foam and ran
her fingers back through her dark hair.  `The house put a con-
tract out on me.  I had to hide for a while.'
  Case stared at her.
  `So Riviera hit a nerve last night,' she said.  `I guess it
wants me to hate him real bad, so I'll be psyched up to go in
there after him.'
  `After him?'
  `He's already there.  Straylight.  On the invitation of Lady
3Jane, all that dedication shit.  She was there in a private box,
kinda...'
  Case remembered the face he'd seen.  `You gonna kill him?'
  She smiled.  Cold.  `He's going to die, yeah.  Soon.'
  `I had a visit too,' he said, and told her about the window,
stumbling over what the Zone-figure had said about Linda.  She
nodded.
  `Maybe it wants you to hate something too.'
  `Maybe I hate it.'
  `Maybe you hate yourself, Case.'

  `How was it?' Bruce asked, as Case climbed into the Honda.
  `Try it sometime,' he said, rubbing his eyes.
  `Just can't see you the kinda guy goes for the puppets,'
Cath said unhappily, thumbing a fresh derm against her wrist.
  `Can we go home, now?' Bruce asked.
  `Sure.  Drop me down Jules Verne, where the bars are.'



        12

  Rue Jules Verne was a circumferential avenue, looping the
spindle's midpoint, while Desiderata ran its length, terminating
at either end in the supports of the Lado-Acheson light pumps. 
If you turned right, off Desiderata, and followed Jules Verne
far enough, you'd find yourself approaching Desiderata from
the left.
  Case watched Bruce's trike until it was out of sight, then
turned and walked past a vast, brilliantly lit newsstand, the
covers of dozens of glossy Japanese magazines presenting the
faces of the month's newest simstim stars.
  Directly overhead, along the nighted axis, the hologram sky
glittered with fanciful constellations suggesting playing cards,
the faces of dice, a top hat, a martini glass.  The intersection
of Desiderata and Jules Verne formed a kind of gulch, the
balconied terraces of Freeside cliff dwellers rising gradually to
the grassy tablelands of another casino complex.  Case watched
a drone microlight bank gracefully in an updraft at the green
verge of an artificial mesa, lit for seconds by the soft glow of
the invisible casino.  The thing was a kind of pilotless biplane
of gossamer polymer, its wings silkscreened to resemble a giant
butterfly.  Then it was gone, beyond the mesa's edge.  He'd
seen a wink of reflected neon off glass, either lenses or the
turrets of lasers.  The drones were part of the spindle's security
system, controlled by some central computer.
  In Straylight?  He walked on, past bars named the Hi-Lo,
the Paradise, le Monde, Cricketeer.  Shozoku Smith's, Emer-
gency.  He chose Emergency because it was the smallest and
most crowded, but it took only seconds for him to realize that
it was a tourist place.  No hum of biz here, only a glazed sexual
tension.  He thought briefly of the nameless club above Molly's
rented cubicle, but the image of her mirrored eyes fixed on the
little screen dissuaded him.  What was Wintermute revealing
there now?  The ground plans of the Villa Straylight?  The history
of the Tessier-Ashpools?
  He bought a mug of Carlsberg and found a place against
the wall.  Closing his eyes, he felt for the knot of rage, the pure
small coal of his anger.  It was there still.  Where had it come
from?  He remembered feeling only a kind of bafflement at his
maiming in Memphis, nothing at all when he'd killed to defend
his dealing interests in Night City, and a slack sickness and
loathing after Linda's death under the inflated dome.  But no
anger.  Small and far away, on the mind's screen, a semblance
of Deane struck a semblance of an office wall in an explosion
of brains and blood.  He knew then: the rage had come in the
arcade, when Wintermute rescinded the simstim ghost of Linda
Lee, yanking away the simple animal promise of food, warmth,
a place to sleep.  But he hadn't become aware of it until his
exchange with the holo-construct of Lonny Zone.
  It was a strange thing.  He couldn't take its measure.
  `Numb,' he said.  He'd been numb a long time, years.  All
his nights down Ninsei, his nights with Linda, numb in bed
and numb at the cold sweating center of every drug deal.  But
now he'd found this warm thing, this chip of murder.  _Meat,_
some part of him said.  _It's the meat talking, ignore it._
  `Gangster.'
  He opened his eyes.  Cath stood beside him in a black shift,
her hair still wild from the ride in the Honda.
  `Thought you went home,' he said, and covered his con-
fusion with a sip of Carlsberg.
  `I got him to drop me off at this shop.  Bought this.'  She
ran her palm across the fabric, curve of the pelvic girdle.  He
saw the blue derm on her wrist.  `Like it?'
  `Sure.'  He automatically scanned the faces around them,
then looked back at her.  `What do you think you're up to,
honey?'
  `You like the beta you got off us, Lupus?'  She was very
close now, radiating heat and tension, eyes slitted over enor-
mous pupils and a tendon in her neck tense as a bowstring. 
She was quivering, vibrating invisibly with the fresh buzz. 
`You get off?'
  `Yeah.  But the comedown's a bitch.'
  `Then you need another one.'
  `And what's that supposed to lead to?'
  `I got a key.  Up the hill behind the Paradise, just the cream-
iest crib.  People down the well on business tonight, if you
follow me...'
  `If I follow you.'
  She took his hand between hers, her palms hot and dry. 
`You're Yak, aren't you, Lupus?  Gaijin soldierman for the
Yakuza.'
  `You got an eye, huh?'  He withdrew his hand and fumbled
for a cigarette.
  `How come you got all your fingers, then?  I thought you
had to chop one off every time you screwed up.'
  `I never screw up.'  He lit his cigarette.
  `I saw that girl you're with.  Day I met you.  Walks like
Hideo.  Scares me.'  She smiled too widely.  `I like that.  She
like it with girls?'
  `Never said.  Who's Hideo?'
  `3Jane's, what she calls it, retainer.  Family retainer.'
  Case forced himself to stare dully at the Emergency crowd
while he spoke.  `Dee-Jane?'
  `Lady 3Jane.  She's triff.  Rich.  Her father owns all this.'
  `This bar?'
  `Freeside!'
  `No shit.  You keepin'~ some class company, huh?'  He raised
an eyebrow.  Put his arm around her, his hand on her hip.  `So
how you meet these aristos, Cathy?  You some kinda closet
deb?  You an'~ Bruce secret heirs to some ripe old credit?  Huh?' 
He spread his fingers, kneading the flesh beneath the thin black
cloth.  She squirmed against him.  Laughed.
  `Oh, you know,' she said, lids half lowered in what must
have been intended as a look of modesty, `she likes to party. 
Bruce and I, we make the party circuit...  It gets real boring
for her, in there.  Her old man lets her out sometimes, as long
as she brings Hideo to take care of her.'
  `Where's it get boring?'
  `Straylight, they call it.  She told me, oh, it's pretty, all the
pools and lilies.  It's a castle, a real castle, all stone and sunsets.' 
She snuggled in against him.  `Hey, Lupus, man, you need a
derm.  So we can be together.'
  She wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck-thong.  Her
nails were bright pink against her boosted tan, bitten to the
quick.  She opened the purse and withdrew a paperbacked bub-
ble with a blue derm inside.  Something white tumbled to the
floor; Case stooped and picked it up.  An origami crane.
  `Hideo gave it to me,' she said.  `He tried to show me how,
but I can't ever get it right.  The necks come out backwards.' 
She tucked the folded paper back into her purse.  Case watched
as she tore the bubble away, peeled the derm from its backing,
and smoothed it across his inner wrist.
  `3Jane, she's got a pointy face, nose like a bird?'  He watched
his hands fumble an outline.  `Dark hair?  Young?'
  `I guess.  But she's _triff,_ you know?  Like, all that money.'
  The drug hit him like an express train, a white-hot column
of light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate,
illuminating the sutures of his skull with x-rays of short-cir-
cuited sexual energy.  His teeth sang in their individual sockets
like tuning forks, each one pitch-perfect and clear as ethanol. 
His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed
and polished, the joints lubricated with a film of silicone.  Sand-
storms raged across the scoured floor of his skull, generating
waves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes, spheres
of purest crystal, expanding...
  `Come on,' she said, taking his hand.  `You got it now. 
We got it.  Up the hill, we'll have it all night.'
  The anger was expanding, relentless, exponential, riding
out behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave, a
seismic fluid, rich and corrosive.  His erection was a bar of
lead.  The faces around them in Emergency were painted doll
things, the pink and white of mouth parts moving, moving,
words emerging like discrete balloons of sound.  He looked at
Cath and saw each pore in the tanned skin, eyes flat as dumb
glass, a tint of dead metal, a faint bloating, the most minute
asymmetries of breast and collarbone, the -- something flared
white behind his eyes.
  He dropped her hand and stumbled for the door, shoving
someone out of the way.
  `Fuck you!' she screamed behind him, `you ripoff shit!'
  He couldn't feel his legs.  He used them like stilts, swaying
crazily across the flagstone pavement of Jules Verne, a distant
rumbling in his ears, his own blood, razored sheets of light
bisecting his skull at a dozen angles.
  And then he was frozen, erect, fists tight against his thighs,
head back, his lips curled, shaking.  While he watched the
loser's zodiac of Freeside, the nightclub constellations of the
hologram sky, shift, sliding fluid down the axis of darkness,
to swarm like live things at the dead center of reality.  Until
they had arranged themselves, individually and in their hundreds,
to form a vast simple portrait, stippled the ultimate mono-
chrome, stars against night sky.  Face of Miss Linda Lee.
  When he was able to look away, to lower his eyes, he found
every other face in the street upraised, the strolling tourists
becalmed with wonder.  And when the lights in the sky went
out, a ragged cheer went up from Jules Verne, to echo off the
terraces and ranked balconies of lunar concrete.
  Somewhere a clock began to chime, some ancient bell out
of Europe.
  Midnight.

  He walked till morning.
  The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly,
flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of
his life.  He couldn't think.  He liked that very much, to be
conscious and unable to think.  He seemed to become each
thing he saw: a park bench, a cloud of white moths around an
antique streetlight, a robot gardener striped diagonally with
black and yellow.
  A recorded dawn crept along the Lado-Acheson system,
pink and lurid.  He forced himself to eat an omelette in a De-
siderata cafe, to drink water, to smoke the last of his cigarettes. 
The rooftop meadow of the Intercontinental was stirring as he
crossed it, an early breakfast crowd intent on coffee and crois-
sants beneath the striped umbrellas.
  He still had his anger.  That was like being rolled in some
alley and waking to discover your wallet still in your pocket,
untouched.  He warmed himself with it, unable to give it a name
or an object.
  He rode the elevator down to his level, fumbling in his
pocket for the Freeside credit chip that served as his key.  Sleep
was becoming real, was something he might do.  To lie down
on the sand-colored temperfoam and find the blankness again.
  They were waiting there, the three of them, their perfect
white sportsclothes and stenciled tans setting off the handwoven
organic chic of the furniture.  The girl sat on a wicker sofa, an
automatic pistol beside her on the leaf-patterned print of the
cushion.
  `Turing,' she said.  `You are under arrest.'



        PART FOUR
        THE STRAYLIGHT RUN


        13

  `Your name is Henry Dorsett Case.'  She recited the year
and place of his birth, his BAMA Single Identification Number,
and a string of names he gradually recognized as aliases from
his past.
  `You been here awhile?'  He saw the contents of his bag
spread out across the bed, unwashed clothing sorted by type. 
The shuriken lay by itself, between jeans and underwear, on
the sand-tinted temperfoam.
  `Where is Kolodny?'  The two men sat side by side on the
couch, their arms crossed over tanned chests, identical gold
chains slung around their necks.  Case peered at them and saw
that their youth was counterfeit, marked by a certain telltale
corrugation at the knuckles, something the surgeons were un-
able to erase.
  `Who's Kolodny?'
  `That was the name in the register.  Where is she?'
  `I dunno,' he said, crossing to the bar and pouring himself
a glass of mineral water.  `She took off.'
  `Where did you go tonight, Case?'  The girl picked up the
pistol and rested it on her thigh, without actually pointing it at
him.
  `Jules Verne, couple of bars, got high.  How about you?' 
His knees felt brittle.  The mineral water was warm and flat.
  `I don't think you grasp your situation,' said the man on
the left, taking a pack of Gitanes from the breast pocket of his
white mesh blouse.  `You are busted, Mr.~ Case.  The charges
have to do with conspiracy to augment an artificial intelli-
gence.'  He took a gold Dunhill from the same pocket and
cradled it in his palm.  `The man you call Armitage is already
in custody.'
  `Corto?'
  The man's eyes widened.  `Yes.  How do you know that that
is his name?'  A millimeter of flame clicked from the lighter.
  `I forget,' Case said.
  `You'll remember,' the girl said.

  Their names, or worknames, were Michle, Roland, and
Pierre.  Pierre, Case decided, would play the Bad Cop, Roland
would take Case's side, provide small kindnesses -- he found
an unopened pack of Yeheyuans when Case refused a Gitane --
and generally play counterpoint to Pierre's cold hostility. 
Michle would be the Recording Angel, making occasional
adjustments in the direction of the interrogation.  One or all of
them, he was certain, would be kinked for audio, very likely
for simstim, and anything he said or did now was admissible
evidence.  Evidence, he asked himself, through the grinding
come-down, of what?
  Knowing that he couldn't follow their French, they spoke
freely among themselves.  Or seemed to.  He caught enough as
it was: names like Pauley, Armitage, Sense/Net, Panther Mod-
erns protruding like icebergs from an animated sea of Parisian
French.  But it was entirely possible that the names were there
for his benefit.  They always referred to Molly as Kolodny.
  `You say you were hired to make a run, Case,' Roland
said, his slow speech intended to convey reasonableness, `and
that you are unaware of the nature of the target.  Is this not
unusual in your trade?  Having penetrated the defenses, would
you not be unable then to perform the required operation?  And
surely an operation of some kind is required, yes?'  He leaned
forward, elbows on his stenciled brown knees, palms out to
receive Case's explanation.  Pierre paced the room; now he was
by the window, now by the door.  Michle was the kink, Case
decided.  Her eyes never left him.
  `Can I put some clothes on?' he asked.  Pierre had insisted
on stripping him, searching the seams of his jeans.  Now he sat
naked on a wicker footstool, with one foot obscenely white.
  Roland asked Pierre something in French.  Pierre, at the
window again, was peering through a flat little pair of binoc-
ulars.  _`Non,'_ he said absently, and Roland shrugged, raising
his eyebrows at Case.  Case decided it was a good time to smile. 
Roland returned the smile.
  Oldest cop bullshit in the book, Case thought.  `Look,' he
said, `I'm sick.  Had this godawful drug in a bar, you know? 
I wanna lie down.  You got me already.  You say you got
Armitage.  You got him, go ask _him._  I'm just hired help.'
  Roland nodded.  `And Kolodny?'
  `She was with Armitage when he hired me.  Just muscle, a
razorgirl.  Far as I know.  Which isn't too far.'
  `You know that Armitage's real name is Corto,' Pierre said,
his eyes still hidden by the soft plastic flanges of the binoculars. 
`How do you know that, my friend?'
  `I guess he mentioned it sometime,' Case said, regretting
the slip.  `Everybody's got a couple names.  Your name Pierre?'
  `We know how you were repaired in Chiba,' Michle said,
`and that may have been Wintermute's first mistake.'  Case
stared at her as blankly as he could.  The name hadn't been
mentioned before.  `The process employed on you resulted in
the clinic's owner applying for seven basic patents.  Do you
know what that means?'
  `No.'
  `It means that the operator of a black clinic in Chiba City
now owns a controlling interest in three major medical research
consortiums.  This reverses the usual order of things, you see. 
It attracted attention.'  She crossed her brown arms across her
small high breasts and settled back against the print cushion. 
Case wondered how old she might be.  People said that age
always showed in the eyes, but he'd never been able to see it. 
Julie Deane had had the eyes of a disinterested ten-year-old
behind the rose quartz of his glasses.  Nothing old about Michle
but her knuckles.  `Traced you to the Sprawl, lost you again,
then caught up with you as you were leaving for Istanbul.  We
backtracked, traced you through the grid, determined that you'd
instigated a riot at Sense/Net.  Sense/Net was eager to cooperate. 
They ran an inventory for us.  They discovered that McCoy
Pauley's ROM personality construct was missing.'
  `In Istanbul,' Roland said, almost apologetically, `it was
very easy.  The woman had alienated Armitage's contact with
the secret police.'
  `And then you came here,' Pierre said, slipping the bin-
oculars into his shorts pocket.  `We were delighted.'
  `Chance to work on your tan?'
  `You know what we mean,' Michle said.  `If you wish to
pretend that you do not, you only make things more difficult
for yourself.  There is still the matter of extradition.  You will
return with us, Case, as will Armitage.  But where, exactly,
will we all be going?  To Switzerland, where you will be merely
a pawn in the trial of an artificial intelligence?  Or to le BAMA,
where you can be proven to have participated not only in data
invasion and larceny, but in an act of public mischief which
cost fourteen innocent lives?  The choice is yours.'
  Case took a Yeheyuan from his pack; Pierre lit it for him
with the gold Dunhill.  `Would Armitage protect you?'  The
question was punctuated by the lighter's bright jaws snapping
shut.
  Case looked up at him through the ache and bitterness of
betaphenethylamine.  `How old are you, boss?'
  `Old enough to know that you are fucked, burnt, that this
is over and you are in the way.'
  `One thing,' Case said, and drew on his cigarette.  He blew
the smoke up at the Turing Registry agent.  `Do you guys have
any real jurisdiction out here?  I mean, shouldn't you have the
Freeside security team in on this party?  It's their turf, isn't it?' 
He saw the dark eyes harden in the lean boy face and tensed
for the blow, but Pierre only shrugged.
  `It doesn't matter,' Roland said.  `You will come with us. 
We are at home with situations of legal ambiguity.  The treaties
under which our arm of the Registry operates grant us a great
deal of flexibility.  And we _create_ flexibility, in situations where
it is required.'  The mask of amiability was down, suddenly,
Roland's eyes as hard as Pierre's.
  `You are worse than a fool,' Michle said, getting to her
feet, the pistol in her hand.  `You have no care for your species. 
For thousands of years men dreamed of pacts with demons. 
Only now are such things possible.  And what would you be
paid with?  What would your price be, for aiding this thing to
free itself and grow?'  There was a knowing weariness in her
young voice that no nineteen-year-old could have mustered. 
`You will dress now.  You will come with us.  Along with the
one you call Armitage, you will return with us to Geneva and
give testimony in the trial of this intelligence.  Otherwise, we
kill you.  Now.'  She raised the pistol, a smooth black Walther
with an integral silencer.
  `I'm dressing already,' he said, stumbling toward the bed. 
His legs were still numb, clumsy.  He fumbled with a clean
t-shirt.
  `We have a ship standing by.  We will erase Pauley's con-
struct with a pulse weapon.'
  `Sense/Net'll be pissed,' Case said, thinking: and all the
evidence in the Hosaka.
  `They are in some difficulty already, for having owned such
a thing.'
  Case pulled the shirt over his head.  He saw the shuriken on
the bed, lifeless metal, his star.  He felt for the anger.  It was
gone.  Time to give in, to roll with it...  He thought of the
toxin sacs.  `Here comes the meat,' he muttered.
  In the elevator to the meadow, he thought of Molly.  She
might already be in Straylight.  Hunting Riviera.  Hunted, prob-
ably, by Hideo, who was almost certainly the ninja clone of
the Finn's story, the one who'd come to retrieve the talking
head.
  He rested his forehead against the matte black plastic of a
wall panel and closed his eyes.  His limbs were wood, old,
warped and heavy with rain.
  Lunch was being served beneath the trees, under the bright
umbrellas.  Roland and Michle fell into character, chattering
brightly in French.  Pierre came behind.  Michle kept the muz-
zle of her pistol close to his ribs, concealing the gun with a
white duck jacket she draped over her arm.
  Crossing the meadow, weaving between the tables and the
trees, he wondered if she would shoot him if he collapsed now. 
Black fur boiled at the borders of his vision.  He glanced up at
the hot white band of the Lado-Acheson armature and saw a
giant butterfly banking gracefully against recorded sky.
  At the edge of the meadow they came to railinged cliffside,
wild flowers dancing in the updraft from the canyon that was
Desiderata.  Michle tossed her short dark hair and pointed,
saying something in French to Roland.  She sounded genuinely
happy.  Case followed the direction of her gesture and saw the
curve of planing lakes, the white glint of casinos, turquoise
rectangles of a thousand pools, the bodies of bathers, tiny bronze
hieroglyphs, all held in serene approximation of gravity against
the endless curve of Freeside's hull.
  They followed the railing to an ornate iron bridge that arched
over Desiderata.  Michle prodded him with the muzzle of the
Walther.
  `Take it easy, I can't hardly walk today.'
  They were a little over a quarter of the way across when
the microlight struck, its electric engine silent until the carbon
fiber prop chopped away the top of Pierre's skull.
  They were in the thing's shadow for an instant, Case felt
the hot blood spray across the back of his neck, and then
someone tripped him.  He rolled, seeing Michle on her back,
knees up, aiming the Walther with both hands.  _That's a waste
of effort,_ he thought, with the strange lucidity of shock.  She
was trying to shoot down the microlight.
  And then he was running.  He looked back as he passed the
first of the trees.  Roland was running after him.  He saw the
fragile biplane strike the iron railing of the bridge, crumple,
cartwheel, sweeping the girl with it down into Desiderata.
  Roland hadn't looked back.  His face was fixed, white, his
teeth bared.  He had something in his hand.
  The gardening robot took Roland as he passed that same
tree.  It fell straight out of the groomed branches, a thing like
a crab, diagonally striped with black and yellow.
  `You killed 'em,' Case panted, running.  `Crazy mother-
fucker, you killed 'em all...'



        14

  The little train shot through its tunnel at eighty kilometers
per hour.  Case kept his eyes closed.  The shower had helped,
but he'd lost his breakfast when he'd looked down and seen
Pierre's blood washing pink across the white tiles.
  Gravity fell away as the spindle narrowed.  Case's stomach
churned.
  Aerol was waiting with his scooter beside the dock.
  `Case, mon, big problem.'  The soft voice faint in his phones. 
He chinned the volume control and peered into the Lexan
face-plate of Aerol's helmet.
  `Gotta get to _Garvey,_ Aerol.'
  `Yo.  Strap in, mon.  But _Garvey_ captive.  Yacht, came be-
fore, she came back.  Now she lockin'~ steady on _Marcus
Garvey.'_
  Turing?  `Came before?'  Case climbed into the scooter's
frame and began to fasten the straps.
  `Japan yacht.  Brought you package...'
  Armitage.

  Confused images of wasps and spiders rose in Case's mind
as they came in sight of _Marcus Garvey._  The little tug was
snug against the gray thorax of a sleek, insectile ship five times
her length.  The arms of grapples stood out against _Garvey_'s
patched hull with the strange clarity of vacuum and raw sun-
light.  A pale corrugated gangway curved out of the yacht,
snaked sideways to avoid the tug's engines, and covered the
aft hatch.  There was something obscene about the arrangement,
but it had more to do with ideas of feeding than of sex.
  `What's happening with Maelcum?'
  `Maelcum fine.  Nobody come down the tube.  Yacht pilot
talk to him, say relax.'
  As they swung past the gray ship, Case saw the name HAN-
IWA in crisp white capitals beneath an oblong cluster of Jap-
anese.
  `I don't like this, man.  I was thinking maybe it's time we
got our ass out of here anyway.'
  `Maelcum thinkin'~ that precise thing, mon, but _Garvey_ not
be goin'~ far like that.'

  Maelcum was purring a speeded-up patois to his radio when
Case came through the forward lock and removed his helmet.
  `Aerol's gone back to the _Rocker,'_ Case said.
  Maelcum nodded, still whispering to the microphone.
  Case pulled himself over the pilot's drifting tangle of dread-
locks and began to remove his suit.  Maelcum's eyes were
closed now; he nodded as he listened to some reply over a pair
of phones with bright orange pads, his brow creased with con-
centration.  He wore ragged jeans and an old green nylon jacket
with the sleeves ripped out.  Case snapped the red Sanyo suit
to a storage hammock and pulled himself down to the g-web.
  `See what th'~ ghost say, mon,' Maelcum said.  `Computer
keeps askin'~ for you.'
  `So who's up there in that thing?'
  `Same Japan-boy came before.  An'~ now he joined by you
Mister Armitage, come out Freeside...'
  Case put the trodes on and jacked in.

  `Dixie?'
  The matrix showed him the pink spheres of the steel combine
in Sikkim.
  `What you gettin'~ up to, boy?  I been hearin'~ lurid stories. 
Hosaka's patched into a twin bank on your boss's boat now. 
Really hoppin'~.  You pull some Turing heat?'
  `Yeah, but Wintermute killed 'em.'
  `Well, that won't hold 'em long.  Plenty more where those
came from.  Be up here in force.  Bet their decks are all over
this grid sector like flies on shit.  And your boss, Case, he says
go.  He says run it and run it now.'
  Case punched for the Freeside coordinates.
  `Lemme take that a sec, Case...'  The matrix blurred and
phased as the Flatline executed an intricate series of jumps with
a speed and accuracy that made Case wince with envy.
  `Shit, Dixie...'
  `Hey, boy, I was that good when I was alive.  You ain't
seen nothin'~.  No hands!'
  `That's it, huh?  Big green rectangle off left?'
  `You got it.  Corporate core data for Tessier-Ashpool S.A.,
and that ice is generated by their two friendly AI's.  On par
with anything in the military sector, looks to me.  That's king
hell ice, Case, black as the grave and slick as glass.  Fry your
brain soon as look at you.  We get any closer now, it'll have
tracers up our ass and out both ears, be tellin'~ the boys in the
T-A boardroom the size of your shoes and how long your dick
is.'
  `This isn't looking so hot, is it?  I mean, the Turings are on
it.  I was thinking maybe we should try to bail out.  I can take
you.'
  `Yeah?  No shit?  You don't wanna see what that Chinese
program can do?'
  `Well, I...'  Case stared at the green walls of the T-A ice. 
`Well, screw it.  Yeah.  We run.'
  `Slot it.'
  `Hey, Maelcum,' Case said, jacking out, `I'm probably
gonna be under the trodes for maybe eight hours straight.' 
Maelcum was smoking again.  The cabin was swimming in
smoke.  `So I can't get to the head...'
  `No problem, mon.'  The Zionite executed a high forward
somersault and rummaged through the contents of a zippered
mesh bag, coming up with a coil of transparent tubing and
something else, something sealed in a sterile bubble pack.
  He called it a Texas catheter, and Case didn't like it at all.
  He slotted the Chinese virus, paused, then drove it home.
  `Okay,' he said, `we're on.  Listen, Maelcum, if it gets
really funny, you can grab my left wrist.  I'll feel it.  Otherwise,
I guess you do what the Hosaka tells you, okay?'
  `Sure, mon.'  Maelcum lit a fresh joint.
  `And turn the scrubber up.  I don't want that shit tangling
with my neurotransmitters.  I got a bad hangover as it is.'
  Maelcum grinned.
  Case jacked back in.
  `Christ on a crutch,' the Flatline said, `take a look at this.'
  The Chinese virus was unfolding around them.  Polychrome
shadow, countless translucent layers shifting and recombining. 
Protean, enormous, it towered above them, blotting out the
void.
  `Big mother,' the Flatline said.
  `I'm gonna check Molly,' Case said, tapping the simstim
switch.

  Freefall.  The sensation was like diving through perfectly
clear water.  She was falling-rising through a wide tube of fluted
lunar concrete, lit at two-meter intervals by rings of white neon.
  The link was one way.  He couldn't talk to her.
  He flipped.

  `Boy, that is one mean piece of software.  Hottest thing
since sliced bread.  That goddam thing's _invisible._  I just now
rented twenty seconds on that little pink box, four jumps left
of the T-A ice; had a look at what we look like.  We don't. 
We're not there.'
  Case searched the matrix around the Tessier-Ashpool ice
until he found the pink structure, a standard commercial unit,
and punched in closer to it.  `Maybe it's defective.'
  `Maybe, but I doubt it.  Our baby's military, though.  And
new.  It just doesn't register.  If it did, we'd read as some kind
of Chinese sneak attack, but nobody's twigged to us at all. 
Maybe not even the folks in Straylight.'
  Case watched the blank wall that screened Straylight.  `Well,'
he said, `that's an advantage, right?'
  `Maybe.'  The construct approximated laughter.  Case winced
at the sensation.  `I checked ol'~ Kuang Eleven out again for
you, boy.  It's real friendly, long as you're on the trigger end,
jus'~ polite an'~ helpful as can be.  Speaks good English, too. 
You ever hear of slow virus before?'
  `No.'
  `I did, once.  Just an idea, back then.  But that's what ol'~
Kuang's all about.  This ain't bore and inject, it's more like we
interface with the ice so slow, the ice doesn't feel it.  The face
of the Kuang logics kinda sleazes up to the target and mutates,
so it gets to be exactly like the ice fabric.  Then we lock on
and the main programs cut in, start talking circles 'round the
logics in the ice.  We go Siamese twin on 'em before they even
get restless.'  The Flatline laughed.
  `Wish you weren't so damn jolly today, man.  That laugh
of yours sort of gets me in the spine.'
  `Too bad,' the Flatline said.  `Ol'~ dead man needs his laughs.' 
Case slapped the simstim switch.

  And crashed through tangled metal and the smell of dust,
the heels of his hands skidding as they struck slick paper. 
Something behind him collapsed noisily.
  `C'mon,' said the Finn, `ease up a little.'
  Case lay sprawled across a pile of yellowing magazines,
the girls shining up at him in the dimness of Metro Holografix,
a wistful galaxy of sweet white teeth.  He lay there until his
heart had slowed, breathing the smell of old magazines.
  `Wintermute,' he said.
  `Yeah,' said the Finn, somewhere behind him, `you got
it.'
  `Fuck off.'  Case sat up, rubbing his wrists.
  `Come _on,'_ said the Finn, stepping out of a sort of alcove
in the wall of junk.  `This way's better for you, man.'  He took
his Partagas from a coat pocket and lit one.  The smell of Cuban
tobacco filled the shop.  `You want I should come to you in
the matrix like a burning bush?  You aren't missing anything,
back there.  An hour here'll only take you a couple of seconds.'
  `You ever think maybe it gets on my nerves, you coming
on like people I know?'  He stood, swatting pale dust from the
front of his black jeans.  He turned, glaring back at the dusty
shop windows, the closed door to the street.  `What's out there? 
New York?  Or does it just stop?'
  `Well,' said the Finn, `it's like that tree, you know?  Falls
in the woods but maybe there's nobody to hear it.'  He showed
Case his huge front teeth, and puffed his cigarette.  `You can
go for a walk, you wanna.  It's all there.  Or anyway all the
parts of it you ever saw.  This is memory, right?  I tap you, sort
it out, and feed it back in.'
  `I don't have this good a memory,' Case said, looking
around.  He looked down at his hands, turning them over.  He
tried to remember what the lines on his palms were like, but
couldn't.
  `Everybody does,' the Finn said, dropping his cigarette and
grinding it out under his heel, `but not many of you can access
it.  Artists can, mostly, if they're any good.  If you could lay
this construct over the reality, the Finn's place in lower Man-
hattan, you'd see a difference, but maybe not as much as you'd
think.  Memory's holographic, for you.'  The Finn tugged at
one of his small ears.  `I'm different.'
  `How do you mean, holographic?'  The word made him
think of Riviera.
  `The holographic paradigm is the closest thing you've worked
out to a representation of human memory, is all.  But you've
never done anything about it.  People, I mean.'  The Finn stepped
forward and canted his streamlined skull to peer up at Case. 
`Maybe if you had, I wouldn't be happening.'
  `What's that supposed to mean?'
  The Finn shrugged.  His tattered tweed was too wide across
the shoulders, and didn't quite settle back into position.  `I'm
trying to help you, Case.'
  `Why?'
  `Because I need you.'  The large yellow teeth appeared
again.  `And because you need me.'
  `Bullshit.  Can you read my mind, Finn?'  He grimaced. 
`Wintermute, I mean.'
  `Minds aren't _read._  See, you've still got the paradigms
print gave you, and you're barely print-literate.  I can _access_
your memory, but that's not the same as your mind.'  He
reached into the exposed chassis of an ancient television and
withdrew a silver-black vacuum tube.  `See this?  Part of my
DNA, sort of...'  He tossed the thing into the shadows and
Case heard it pop and tinkle.  `You're always building models. 
Stone circles.  Cathedrals.  Pipe-organs.  Adding machines.  I
got no idea why I'm here now, you know that?  But if the
run goes off tonight, you'll have finally managed the real
thing.'
  `I don't know what you're talking about.'
  `That's `you' in the collective.  Your species.'
  `You killed those Turings.'
  The Finn shrugged.  `Hadda.  Hadda.  You should give a shit;
they woulda offed you and never thought twice.  Anyway, why
I got you here, we gotta talk more.  Remember this?'  And his
right hand held the charred wasps'~ nest from Case's dream,
reek of fuel in the closeness of the dark shop.  Case stumbled
back against a wall of junk.  `Yeah.  That was me.  Did it with
the holo rig in the window.  Another memory I tapped out of
you when I flatlined you that first time.  Know why it's im-
portant?'
  Case shook his head.
  `Because' -- and the nest, somehow, was gone -- `it's the
closest thing you got to what Tessier-Ashpool would like to
be.  The human equivalent.  Straylight's like that nest, or anyway
it was supposed to work out that way.  I figure it'll make you
feel better.'
  `Feel better?'
  `To know what they're like.  You were starting to hate my
guts for a while there.  That's good.  But hate them instead. 
Same difference.'
  `Listen,' Case said, stepping forward, `they never did shit
to me.  You, it's different...'  But he couldn't feel the anger.
  `So T-A, they made me.  The French girl, she said you were
selling out the species.  Demon, she said I was.'  The Finn
grinned.  `It doesn't much matter.  You gotta hate somebody
before this is over.'  He turned and headed for the back of the
shop.  `Well, come on, I'll show you a little bit of Straylight
while I got you here.'  He lifted the corner of the blanket.  White
light poured out.  `Shit, man, don't just stand there.'
  Case followed, rubbing his face.
  `Okay,' said the Finn, and grabbed his elbow.
  They were drawn past the stale wool in a puff of dust, into
freefall and a cylindrical corridor of fluted lunar concrete, ringed
with white neon at two-meter intervals.
  `Jesus,' Case said, tumbling.
  `This is the front entrance,' the Finn said, his tweed flap-
ping.  `If this weren't a construct of mine, where the shop is
would be the main gate, up by the Freeside axis.  This'll all be
a little low on detail, though, because you don't have the
memories.  Except for this bit here, you got off Molly...'
  Case managed to straighten out, but began to corkscrew in
a long spiral.
  `Hold on,' the Finn said, `I'll fast-forward us.'
  The walls blurred.  Dizzying sensation of headlong move-
ment, colors, whipping around corners and through narrow
corridors.  They seemed at one point to pass through several
meters of solid wall, a flash of pitch darkness.
  `Here,' the Finn said.  `This is it.'
  They floated in the center of a perfectly square room, walls
and ceiling paneled in rectangular sections of dark wood.  The
floor was covered by a single square of brilliant carpet patterned
after a microchip, circuits traced in blue and scarlet wool.  In
the exact center of the room, aligned precisely with the carpet
pattern, stood a square pedestal of frosted white glass.
  `The Villa Straylight,' said a jeweled thing on the pedestal,
in a voice like music, `is a body grown in upon itself, a Gothic
folly.  Each space in Straylight is in some way secret, this
endless series of chambers linked by passages, by stairwells
vaulted like intestines, where the eye is trapped in narrow
curves, carried past ornate screens, empty alcoves...'
  `Essay of 3Jane's,' the Finn said, producing his Partagas. 
`Wrote that when she was twelve.  Semiotics course.'
  `The architects of Freeside went to great pains to conceal
the fact that the interior of the spindle is arranged with the
banal precision of furniture in a hotel room.  In Straylight, the
hull's inner surface is overgrown with a desperate proliferation
of structures, forms flowing, interlocking, rising toward a solid
core of microcircuitry, our clan's corporate heart, a cylinder
of silicon wormholed with narrow maintenance tunnels, some
no wider than a man's hand.  The bright crabs burrow there,
the drones, alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage.'
  `That was her you saw in the restaurant,' the Finn said.
  `By the standards of the archipelago,' the head continued,
`ours is an old family, the convolutions of our home reflecting
that age.  But reflecting something else as well.  The semiotics
of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void
beyond the hull.
  `~Tessier and Ashpool climbed the well of gravity to discover
that they loathed space.  They built Freeside to tap the wealth
of the new islands, grew rich and eccentric, and began the
construction of an extended body in Straylight.  We have sealed
ourselves away behind our money, growing inward, generating
a seamless universe of self.
  `~The Villa Straylight knows no sky, recorded or otherwise.
  `~At the Villa's silicon core is a small room, the only rec-
tilinear chamber in the complex.  Here, on a plain pedestal of
glass, rests an ornate bust, platinum and cloisonn, studded
with lapis and pearl.  The bright marbles of its eyes were cut
from the synthetic ruby viewport of the ship that brought the
first Tessier up the well, and returned for the first Ashpool...'
  The head fell silent.
  `Well?' Case asked, finally almost expecting the thing to
answer him.
  `That's all she wrote,' the Finn said.  `Didn't finish it.  Just
a kid then.  This thing's a ceremonial terminal, sort of.  I need
Molly in here with the right word at the right time.  That's the
catch.  Doesn't mean shit, how deep you and the Flatline ride
that Chinese virus, if this thing doesn't hear the magic word.'
  `So what's the word?'
  `I don't know.  You might say what I am is basically defined
by the fact that I don't know, because I _can't_ know.  I am that
which knoweth not the word.  If you knew, man, and told me,
I couldn't _know._  It's hardwired in.  Someone else has to learn
it and bring it here, just when you and the Flatline punch
through that ice and scramble the cores.'
  `What happens then?'
  `I don't exist, after that.  I cease.'
  `Okay by me,' Case said.
  `Sure.  But you watch your ass, Case.  My, ah, other lobe
is on to us, it looks like.  One burning bush looks pretty much
like another.  And Armitage is starting to go.'
  `What's that mean?'
  But the paneled room folded itself through a dozen impos-
sible angles, tumbling away into cyberspace like an origami
crane.



        15

  `You tryin'~ to break my record, son?' the Flatline asked. 
`You were braindead again, five seconds.'
  `Sit tight,' Case said, and hit the simstim switch.
  She crouched in darkness, her palms against rough concrete.
  CASE CASE CASE CASE.  The digital display pulsed his
name in alphanumerics, Wintermute informing her of the link.
  `Cute,' she said.  She rocked back on her heels and rubbed
her palms together, cracked her knuckles.  `What kept you?'
  TIME MOLLY TIME NOW.
  She pressed her tongue hard against her lower front teeth. 
One moved slightly, activating her microchannel amps; the
random bounce of photons through the darkness was converted
to a pulse of electrons, the concrete around her coming up
ghost-pale and grainy.  `Okay, honey.  Now we go out to play.'
  Her hiding place proved to be a service tunnel of some kind. 
She crawled out through a hinged, ornate grill of tarnished
brass.  He saw enough of her arms and hands to know that she
wore the polycarbon suit again.  Under the plastic, he felt the
familiar tension of thin tight leather.  There was something slung
under her arm in a harness or holster.  She stood up, unzipped
the suit and touched the checkered plastic of a pistolgrip.
  `Hey, Case,' she said, barely voicing the words, `you lis-
tening?  Tell you a story...  Had me this boy once.  You kinda
remind me...'  She turned and surveyed the corridor.  `Johnny,
his name was.'
  The low, vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum
cases, archaic-looking glass-fronted boxes made of brown wood. 
They looked awkward there, against the organic curves of the
hallway's walls, as though they'd been brought in and set up
in a line for some forgotten purpose.  Dull brass fixtures held
globes of white light at ten-meter intervals.  The floor was
uneven, and as she set off along the corridor, Case realized
that hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at
random.  In some places, they were six deep, the floor a soft
patchwork of handwoven wool.
  Molly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents,
which irritated him.  He had to satisfy himself with her disin-
terested glances, which gave him fragments of pottery antique
weapons, a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it
was unrecognizable, frayed sections of tapestry.
  `My Johnny, see, he was smart, real flash boy.  Started out
as a stash on Memory Lane, chips in his head and people paid
to hide data there.  Had the Yak after him, night I met him,
and I did for their assassin.  More luck than anything else but
I did for him.  And after that, it was tight and sweet, Case.' 
Her lips barely moved.  He felt her form the words, he didn't
need to hear them spoken aloud.  `We had a set-up with a squid,
so we could read the traces of everything he'd ever stored.  Ran
it all out on tape and started twisting selected clients, ex-clients. 
I was bagman, muscle, watchdog.  I was real happy.  You ever
been happy, Case?  He was my boy.  We worked together. 
Partners.  I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house
when I met him...'  She paused, edged around a sharp turn,
and continued.  More of the glossy wooden cases, their sides
a color that reminded him of cockroach wings.
  `Tight, sweet, just ticking along, we were.  Like nobody
could ever touch us.  I wasn't going to let them.  Yakuza.  I
guess, they still wanted Johnny's ass.  'Cause I'd killed their
man.  'Cause Johnny'd burned them.  And the Yak, they can
afford to move so fucking slow, man, they'll wait years and
years.  Give you a whole life, just so you'll have more to lose
when they come and take it away.  Patient like a spider.  Zen
spiders.
  `~I didn't know that, then.  Or if I did.  I figured it didn't
apply to us.  Like when you're young, you figure you're
unique.  I was young.  Then they came, when we were thinking
we maybe had enough to be able to quit, pack it in, go to
Europe maybe.  Not that either of us knew what we'd do there,
with nothing to do.  But we were living fat.  Swiss orbital ac-
counts and a crib full of toys and furniture.  Takes the edge off
your game.
  `~So that first one they'd sent, he'd been hot.  Reflexes like
you never saw, implants, enough style for ten ordinary hoods. 
But the second one, he was.  I dunno, like a _monk._  Cloned. 
Stone killer from the cells on up.  Had it in him, death, this
silence, he gave it off in a cloud...'  Her voice trailed off as
the corridor split, identical stairwells descending.  She took the
left.
  `One time, I was a little kid, we were squatting.  It was
down by the Hudson, and those rats, man, they were big.  It's
the chemicals get into them.  Big as I was, and all night one
had been scrabbling under the floor of the squat.  Round dawn
somebody brought this old man in, seams down his cheeks and
his eyes all red.  Had a roll of greasy leather like you'd keep
steel tools in, to keep the rust off.  Spread it out, had this old
revolver and three shells.  Old man, he puts one bullet in there,
then he starts walking up and down the squat, we're hanging
back by the walls.
  `~Back and forth.  Got his arms crossed, head down, like
he's forgotten the gun.  Listening for the rat.  We got real quiet. 
Old man takes a step.  Rat moves.  Rat moves, he takes another
step.  An hour of that, then he seems to remember his gun. 
Points it at the floor, grins, and pulls the trigger.  Rolled it back
up and left.
  `~I crawled under there later.  Rat had a hole between its
eyes.'  She was watching the sealed doorways that opened at
intervals along the corridor.  `The second one, the one who
came for Johnny, he was like that old man.  Not old, but he
was like that.  He killed that way.'  The corridor widened.  The
sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous can-
delabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the
floor.  Crystal tinkled as Molly entered the hall.  THIRD DOOR
LEFT, blinked the readout.
  She turned left, avoiding the inverted tree of crystal.  `I just
saw him once.  On my way into our place.  He was coming out. 
We lived in a converted factory space, lots of young comers
from Sense/Net, like that.  Pretty good security to start with,
and I'd put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight. 
I knew Johnny was up there.  But this little guy, he caught my
eye, as he was coming out.  Didn't say a word.  We just looked
at each other and I knew.  Plain little guy, plain clothes, no
pride in him, humble.  He looked at me and got into a pedicab. 
I knew.  Went upstairs and Johnny was sitting in a chair by the
window, with his mouth a little open, like he'd just thought of
something to say.'
  The door in front of her was old, a carved slab of Thai teak
that seemed to have been sawn in half to fit the low doorway. 
A primitive mechanical lock with a stainless face had been
inset beneath a swirling dragon.  She knelt, drew a tight little
roll of black chamois from an inside pocket, and selected a
needle-thin pick.  `Never much found anybody I gave a damn
about, after that.'
  She inserted the pick and worked in silence, nibbling at her
lower lip.  She seemed to rely on touch alone, her eyes unfo-
cused and the door was a blur of blond wood.  Case listened
to the silence of the hall, punctuated by the soft clink of the
candelabrum.  Candles?  Straylight was all wrong.  He remem-
bered Cath's story of a castle with pools and lilies, and 3Jane's
mannered words recited musically by the head.  A place grown
in upon itself.  Straylight smelled faintly musty, faintly per-
fumed, like a church.  Where were the Tessier-Ashpools?  He'd
expected some clean hive of disciplined activity, but Molly
had seen no one.  Her monologue made him uneasy; she'd never
told him that much about herself before.  Aside from her story
in the cubicle, she'd seldom said anything that had even in-
dicated that she had a past.
  She closed her eyes and there was a click that Case felt
rather than heard.  It made him remember the magnetic locks
on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place.  The door had
opened for him, even though he'd had the wrong chip.  That
was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manip-
ulated the drone micro and the robot gardener.  The lock system
in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside's security
system.  The simple mechanical lock here would pose a real
problem for the AI, requiring either a drone of some kind or
a human agent.
  She opened her eyes, put the pick back into the chamois,
carefully rerolled it, and tucked it back into its pocket.  `Guess
you're kinda like he was,' she said.  `Think you're born to run. 
Figure what you were into back in Chiba, that was a stripped
down version of what you'd be doing anywhere.  Bad luck, it'll
do that sometimes, get you down to basics.'  She stood, stretched,
shook herself.  `You know, I figure the one Tessier-Ashpool
sent after that Jimmy, the boy who stole the head, he must be
pretty much the same as the one the Yak sent to kill Johnny.' 
She drew the fletcher from its holster and dialed the barrel to
full auto.
  The ugliness of the door struck Case as she reached for it. 
Not the door itself, which was beautiful, or had once been part
of some more beautiful whole, but the way it had been sawn
down to fit a particular entrance.  Even the shape was wrong,
a rectangle amid smooth curves of polished concrete.  They'd
imported these things, he thought, and then forced it all to fit. 
But none of it fit.  The door was like the awkward cabinets,
the huge crystal tree.  Then he remembered 3Jane's essay, and
imagined that the fittings had been hauled up the well to flesh
out some master plan, a dream long lost in the compulsive
effort to fill space, to replicate some family image of self.  He
remembered the shattered nest, the eyeless things writhing...
  Molly grasped one of the carved dragon's forelegs and the
door swung open easily.
  The room behind was small, cramped, little more than a
closet.  Gray steel tool cabinets were backed against a curving
wall.  A light fixture had come on automatically.  She closed
the door behind her and went to the ranged lockers.
  THIRD LEFT, pulsed the optic chip, Wintermute overriding
her time display.  FIVE DOWN.  But she opened the top drawer
first.  It was no more than a shallow tray.  Empty.  The second
was empty as well.  The third, which was deeper, contained
dull beads of solder and a small brown thing that looked like
a human fingerbone.  The fourth drawer held a damp-swollen
copy of an obsolete technical manual in French and Japanese. 
In the fifth, behind the armored gauntlet of a heavy vacuum
suit, she found the key.  It was like a dull brass coin with a
short hollow tube braised against one edge.  She turned it slowly
in her hand and Case saw that the interior of the tube was lined
with studs and flanges.  The letters CHUBB were molded across
one face of the coin.  The other was blank.
  `He told me,' she whispered.  `Wintermute.  How he played
a waiting game for years.  Didn't have any real power, then,
but he could use the Villa's security and custodial systems to
keep track of where everything was, how things moved, where
they went.  He saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago,
and he managed to get somebody else to leave it here.  Then
he killed him, the boy who'd brought it here.  Kid was eight.' 
She closed her white fingers over the key.  `So nobody would
find it.'  She took a length of black nylon cord from the suit's
kangaroo pocket and threaded it through the round hole above
CHUBB.  Knotting it, she hung it around her neck.  `They were
always fucking him over with how old-fashioned they were,
he said, all their nineteenth-century stuff.  He looked just like
the Finn, on the screen in that meat puppet hole.  Almost thought
he _was_ the Finn, if I wasn't careful.'  Her readout flared the
time, alphanumerics superimposed over the gray steel chests. 
`He said if they'd turned into what they'd wanted to, he
could've gotten out a long time ago.  But they didn't.  Screwed
up.  Freaks like 3Jane.  That's what he called her, but he talked
like he liked her.'
  She turned, opened the door, and stepped out, her hand
brushing the checkered grip of the holstered fletcher.
  Case flipped.

  Kuang Grade Mark Eleven was growing.
  `Dixie, you think this thing'll work?'
  `Does a bear shit in the woods?'  The Flatline punched them
up through shifting rainbow strata.
  Something dark was forming at the core of the Chinese
program.  The density of information overwhelmed the fabric
of the matrix, triggering hypnagogic images.  Faint kaleidoscop-
ic angles centered in to a silver-black focal point.  Case watched
childhood symbols of evil and bad luck tumble out along trans-
lucent planes: swastikas, skulls and crossbones, dice flashing
snake eyes.  If he looked directly at that null point, no outline
would form.  It took a dozen quick, peripheral takes before he
had it, a shark thing, gleaming like obsidian, the black mirrors
of its flanks reflecting faint distant lights that bore no relation-
ship to the matrix around it.
  `That's the sting,' the construct said.  `When Kuang's good
and bellytight with the Tessier-Ashpool core, we're ridin'~ that
through.'
  `You were right, Dix.  There's some kind of manual override
on the hardwiring that keeps Wintermute under control.  How-
ever much he _is_ under control,' he added.
  `He,' the construct said.  `He.  Watch that.  It.  I keep telling
you.'
  `It's a code.  A word, he said.  Somebody has to speak it
into a fancy terminal in a certain room, while we take care of
whatever's waiting for us behind that ice.'
  `Well, you got time to kill, kid,' the flatline said.  `Ol'~
Kuang's slow but steady.'
  Case jacked out.

  Into Maelcum's stare.
  `You dead awhile there, mon.'
  `It happens,' he said.  `I'm getting used to it.'
  `You dealin'~ wi'~ th'~ darkness, mon.'
  `Only game in town, it looks like.'
  `Jah love, Case,' Maelcum said, and turned back to his
radio module.  Case stared at the matted dreadlocks, the ropes
of muscle around the man's dark arms.
  He jacked back in.
  And flipped.

  Molly was trotting along a length of corridor that might
have been the one she'd traveled before.  The glass-fronted cases
were gone now, and Case decided they were moving toward
the tip of the spindle; gravity was growing weaker.  Soon she
was bounding smoothly over rolling hillocks of carpets.  Faint
twinges in her leg...
  The corridor narrowed suddenly, curved split.
  She turned right and started up a freakishly steep flight of
stairs, her leg beginning to ache.  Overhead, strapped and bun-
dled cables hugged the stairwell's ceiling like colorcoded gan-
glia.  The walls were splotched with damp.
  She arrived at a triangular landing and stood rubbing her
leg.  More corridors, narrow, their walls hung with rugs.  They
branched away in three directions.
  LEFT.
  She shrugged.  `Lemme look around, okay?'
  LEFT.
  `Relax.  There's time.'  She started down the corridor that
led off to her right.
  STOP.
  GO BACK.
  DANGER.
  She hesitated.  From the half-open oak door at the far end
of the passage came a voice, loud and slurred, like the voice
of a drunk.  Case thought the language might be French, but it
was too indistinct.  Molly took a step, another, her hand sliding
into the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher.  When she stepped
into the neural disruptor's field, her ears rang, a tiny rising
tone that made Case think of the sound of her fletcher.  She
pitched forward, her striated muscles slack, and struck the door
with her forehead.  She twisted and lay on her back, her eyes
unfocused, breath gone.
  `What's this,' said the slurred voice, `fancy dress?'  A trem-
bling hand entered the front of her suit and found the fletcher,
tugging it out.  `Come visit, child.  Now.'
  She got up slowly, her eyes fixed on the muzzle of a black
automatic pistol.  The man's hand was steady enough, now; the
gun's barrel seemed to be attached to her throat with a taut,
invisible string.
  He was old, very tall, and his features reminded Case of
the girl he had glimpsed in the Vingtime Sicle.  He wore a
heavy robe of maroon silk, quilted around the long cuffs and
shawl collar.  One foot was bare, the other in a black velvet
slipper with an embroidered gold foxhead over the instep.  He
motioned her into the room.  `Slow, darling.'  The room was
very large, cluttered with an assortment of things that made no
sense to Case.  He saw a gray steel rack of old-fashioned Sony
monitors, a wide brass bed heaped with sheepskins, with pil-
lows that seemed to have been made from the kind of rug used
to pave the corridors.  Molly's eyes darted from a huge Tele-
funken entertainment console to shelves of antique disk re-
cordings, their crumbling spines cased in clear plastic, to a
wide worktable littered with slabs of silicon.  Case registered
the cyberspace deck and the trodes, but her glance slid over it
without pausing.
  `It would be customary,' the old man said, `for me to kill
you now.'  Case felt her tense, ready for a move.  `But tonight
I indulge myself.  What is your name?'
  `Molly.'
  `Molly.  Mine is Ashpool.'  He sank back into the creased
softness of a huge leather armchair with square chrome legs,
but the gun never wavered.  He put her fletcher on a brass table
beside the chair, knocking over a plastic vial of red pills.  The
table was thick with vials, bottles of liquor, soft plastic en-
velopes spilling white powders.  Case noticed an old-fashioned
glass hypodermic and a plain steel spoon.
  `How do you cry, Molly?  I see your eyes are walled away. 
I'm curious.'  His eyes were red-rimmed, his forehead gleaming
with sweat.  He was very pale.  Sick, Case decided.  Or drugs.
  `I don't cry, much.'
  `But how would you cry, if someone made you cry?'
  `I spit,' she said.  `The ducts are routed back into my mouth.'
  `Then you've already learned an important lesson, for one
so young.'  He rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and
took a bottle from the table beside him, without bothering to
choose from the half-dozen different liquors.  He drank.  Brandy. 
A trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his mouth.  `That
is the way to handle tears.'  He drank again.  `I'm busy tonight,
Molly.  I built all this, and now I'm busy.  Dying.'
  `I could go out the way I came,' she said.
  He laughed, a harsh high sound.  `You intrude on my suicide
and then ask to simply walk out?  Really, you amaze me.  A
thief.'
  `It's my ass, boss, and it's all I got.  I just wanna get it out
of here in one piece.'
  `You are a very rude girl.  Suicides here are conducted with
a degree of decorum.  That's what I'm doing, you understand. 
But perhaps I'll take you with me tonight, down to hell...  It
would be very Egyptian of me.'  He drank again.  `Come here
then.'  He held out the bottle, his hand shaking.  `Drink.'
  She shook her head.
  `It isn't poisoned,' he said, but returned the brandy to the
table.  `Sit.  Sit on the floor.  We'll talk.'
  `What about?'  She sat.  Case felt the blades move, very
slightly, beneath her nails.
  `Whatever comes to mind.  My mind.  It's my party.  The
cores woke me.  Twenty hours ago.  Something was afoot, they
said, and I was needed.  Were you the something Molly?  Surely
they didn't need me to handle you, no.  Something else... but
I'd been dreaming, you see.  For thirty years.  You weren't born,
when last I lay me down to sleep.  They told us we wouldn't
dream, in that cold.  They told us we'd never feel cold, either. 
Madness, Molly.  Lies.  Of course I dreamed.  The cold let the
outside in, that was it.  The outside.  All the night I built this
to hide us from.  Just a drop, at first, one grain of night seeping
in, drawn by the cold...  Others following it, filling my head
the way rain fills an empty pool.  Calla lilies.  I remember.  The
pools were terracotta, nursemaids all of chrome, how the limbs
went winking through the gardens at sunset...  I'm old, Molly. 
Over two hundred years, if you count the cold.  The cold.'  The
barrel of the pistol snapped up suddenly, quivering.  The ten-
dons in her thighs were drawn tight as wires now.
  `You can get freezerburn,' she said carefully.
  `Nothing burns there,' he said impatiently, lowering the
gun.  His few movements were increasingly sclerotic.  His head
nodded.  It cost him an effort to stop it.  `Nothing burns.  I
remember now.  The cores told me our intelligences are mad. 
And all the billions we paid, so long ago.  When artificial
intelligences were rather a racy concept.  I told the cores I'd
deal with it.  Bad timing, really, with 8Jean down in Melbourne
and only our sweet 3Jane minding the store.  Or very good
timing, perhaps.  Would you know, Molly?'  The gun rose again. 
`There are some odd things afoot now, in the Villa Straylight.'
  `Boss,' she asked him, `you know Wintermute?'
  `A name.  Yes.  To conjure with, perhaps.  A lord of hell,
surely.  In my time, dear Molly, I have known many lords. 
And not a few ladies.  Why, a queen of Spain, once, in that
very bed...  But I wander.'  He coughed wetly, the muzzle of
the pistol jerking as he convulsed.  He spat on the carpet near
his one bare foot.  `How I do wander.  Through the cold.  But
soon no more.  I'd ordered a Jane thawed, when I woke.  Strange,
to lie every few decades with what legally amounts to one's
own daughter.'  His gaze swept past her, to the rack of blank
monitors.  He seemed to shiver.  `Marie-France's eyes ,' he said,
faintly, and smiled.  `We cause the brain to become allergic to
certain of its own neurotransmitters, resulting in a peculiarly
pliable imitation of autism.'  His head swayed sideways, re-
covered.  `I understand that the effect is now more easily ob-
tained with an embedded microchip.'
  The pistol slid from his fingers, bounced on the carpet.
  `The dreams grow like slow ice,' he said.  His face was
tinged with blue.  His head sank back into the waiting leather
and he began to snore.
  Up, she snatched the gun.  She stalked the room, Ashpool's
automatic in her hand.
  A vast quilt or comforter was heaped beside the bed, in a
broad puddle of congealed blood, thick and shiny on the pat-
terned rugs.  Twitching a corner of the quilt back, she found
the body of a girl, white shoulder blades slick with blood.  Her
throat had been slit.  The triangular blade of some sort of scraper
glinted in the dark pool beside her.  Molly knelt, careful to
avoid the blood, and turned the dead girl's face to the light. 
The face Case had seen in the restaurant.
  There was a click, deep at the very center of things, and
the world was frozen.  Molly's simstim broadcast had become
a still frame, her fingers on the girl's cheek.  The freeze held
for three seconds, and then the dead face was altered, became
the face of Linda Lee.
  Another click, and the room blurred.  Molly was standing,
looking down at a golden laser disk beside a small console on
the marble top of a bedside table.  A length of fiberoptic ribbon
ran like a leash from the console to a socket at the base of the
slender neck.
  `I got your number, fucker,' Case said, feeling his own lips
moving, somewhere, far away.  He knew that Wintermute had
altered the broadcast.  Molly hadn't seen the dead girl's face
swirl like smoke, to take on the outline of Linda's deathmask.
  Molly turned.  She crossed the room to Ashpool's chair.  The
man's breathing was slow and ragged.  She peered at the litter
of drugs and alcohol.  She put his pistol down, picked up her
fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very carefully
put a toxin dart through the center of his closed left eyelid.  He
jerked once, breath halting in mid-intake.  His other eye, brown
and fathomless, opened slowly.
  It was still open when she turned and left the room.



        16

  `Got your boss on hold,' the Flatline said.  `He's coming
through on the twin Hosaka in that boat upstairs, the one that's
riding us piggy-back.  Called the _Haniwa.'_
  `I know,' Case said, absently, `I saw it.'
  A lozenge of white light clicked into place in front of him,
hiding the Tessier-Ashpool ice; it showed him the calm, per-
fectly focused, utterly crazy face of Armitage, his eyes blank
as buttons.  Armitage blinked.  Stared.
  `Guess Wintermute took care of your Turings too, huh? 
Like he took care of mine,' Case said.
  Armitage stared.  Case resisted the sudden urge to look away,
drop his gaze.  `You okay, Armitage?'
  `Case' -- and for an instant something seemed to move,
behind the blue stare -- `you've seen Wintermute, haven't you? 
In the matrix.'
  Case nodded.  A camera on the face of his Hosaka in _Marcus
Garvey_ would relay the gesture to the _Haniwa_ monitor.  He
imagined Maelcum listening to his tranced half conversations,
unable to hear the voices of the construct or Armitage.
  `Case' -- and the eyes grew larger, Armitage leaning toward
his computer -- `what is he, when you see him?'
  `A high-rez simstim construct.'
  `But _who?'_
  `Finn, last time...  Before that, this pimp I...'
  `Not General Girling?'
  `General who?'
  The lozenge went blank.
  `Run that back and get the Hosaka to look it up,' he told
the construct.
  He flipped.

  The perspective startled him.  Molly was crouching between
steel girders, twenty meters above a broad, stained floor of
polished concrete.  The room was a hangar or service bay.  He
could see three spacecraft, none larger than _Garvey_ and all in
various stages of repair.  Japanese voices.  A figure in an orange
jumpsuit stepped from a gap in the hull of a bulbous construc-
tion vehicle and stood beside one of the thing's piston-driven,
weirdly anthropomorphic arms.  The man punched something
into a portable console and scratched his ribs.  A cartlike red
drone rolled into sight on gray balloon tires.
  CASE, flashed her chip.
  `Hey,' she said.  `Waiting for a guide.'
  She settled back on her haunches, the arms and knees of
her Modern suit the color of the blue-gray paint on the girders,
Her leg hurt, a sharp steady pain now.  `I shoulda gone back
to Chin,' she muttered.
  Something came ticking quietly out of the shadows, on a
level with her left shoulder.  It paused, swayed its spherical body
from side to side on high-arched spider legs, fired a micro-
second burst of diffuse laserlight, and froze.  It was a Braun
microdrone, and Case had once owned the same model, a
pointless accessory he'd obtained as part of a package deal with
a Cleveland hardware fence.  It looked like a stylized matte
black daddy longlegs.  A red LED began to pulse, at the sphere's
equator.  Its body was no larger than a baseball.  `Okay,' she
said, `I hear you.'  She stood up, favoring her left leg, and
watched the little drone reverse.  It picked its methodical way
back across its girder and into darkness.  She turned and looked
back at the service area.  The man in the orange jumpsuit was
sealing the front of a white vacuum rig.  She watched him ring
and seal the helmet, pick up his console, and step back through
the gap in the construction boat's hull.  There was a rising whine
of motors and the thing slid smoothly out of sight on a ten-
meter circle of flooring that sank away into a harsh glare of
arc lamps.  The red drone waited patiently at the edge of the
hole left by the elevator panel.
  Then she was off after the Braun, threading her way between
a forest of welded steel struts.  The Braun winked its LED
steadily, beckoning her on.
  `How you doin'~, Case?  You back in _Garvey_ with Maelcum? 
Sure.  And jacked into this.  I like it, you know?  Like I've always
talked to myself, in my head, when I've been in tight spots. 
Pretend I got some friend, somebody I can trust, and I'll tell
'em what I really think, what I feel like, and then I'll pretend
they're telling me what they think about that, and I'll just go
along that way.  Having you in is kinda like that.  That scene
with Ashpool...'  She gnawed at her lower lip, swinging around
a strut, keeping the drone in sight.  `I was expecting something
maybe a little less gone, you know?  I mean, these guys are all
batshit in here, like they got luminous messages scrawled across
the inside of their foreheads or something.  I don't like the way
it looks, I don't like the way it smells...'
  The drone was hoisting itself up a nearly invisible ladder
of U-shaped steel rungs, toward a narrow dark opening.  `And
while I'm feeling confessional, baby, I gotta admit maybe I
never much expected to make it out of this one anyway.  Been
on this bad roll for a while, and you're the only good change
come down since I signed on with Armitage.'  She looked up
at the black circle.  The drone's LED winked, climbing.  `Not
that you're all that shit hot.'  She smiled, but it was gone too
quickly, and she gritted her teeth at the stabbing pain in her
leg as she began to climb.  The ladder continued up through a
metal tube, barely wide enough for her shoulders.
  She was climbing up out of gravity, toward the weightless
axis.
  Her chip pulsed the time.
  04:23:04.
  It had been a long day.  The clarity of her sensorium cut the
bite of the betaphenethylamine, but Case could still feel it.  He
preferred the pain in her leg.

  `Guess it's for you,' she said, climbing mechanically.  The
zeros strobed again and a message stuttered there, in the corner
of her vision, chopped up by the display circuit.

  `Well,' she said, pausing, taking all of her weight on her
right leg, `guess you got problems too.'  She looked down. 
There was a faint circle of light, no larger than the brass round
of the Chubb key that dangled between her breasts.  She looked
up.  Nothing at all.  She tongued her amps and the tube rose
into vanishing perspective, the Braun picking its way up the
rungs.  `Nobody told me about this part,' she said.
  Case jacked out.

  `Maelcum...'
  `Mon, you bossman gone ver'~ strange.'  The Zionite was
wearing a blue Sanyo vacuum suit twenty years older than the
one Case had rented in Freeside, its helmet under his arm and
his dreadlocks bagged in a net cap crocheted from purple
cotton yarn.  His eyes were slitted with ganja and tension.  `Keep
callin'~ down here wi'~ _orders,_ mon, but be some Babylon war...' 
Maelcum shook his head.  `Aerol an'~ I talkin'~, an'~ Aerol talkin'~
wi'~ Zion, Founders seh cut an'~ run.'  He ran the back of a large
brown hand across his mouth.
  `Armitage?'  Case winced as the betaphenethylamine hang-
over hit him with its full intensity, unscreened by the matrix
or simstim.  Brain's got no nerves in it, he told himself, it can't
really feel this bad.  `What do you mean, man?  He's giving
you orders?  What?'
  `Mon, Armitage, he tellin'~ me set course for Finland, ya
know?  He tellin'~ me there be hope, ya know?  Come on my
screen wi'~ his shirt all blood, mon, an'~ be crazy as some dog,
talkin'~ screamin'~ fists an'~ Russian an'~ th'~ blood of th'~ betrayers
shall be on our hands.'  He shook his head again, the dreadcap
swaying and bobbing in zero-g, his lips narrowed.  `Founders
seh the Mute voice be false prophet surely, an'~ Aerol an'~ I
mus'~ 'bandon _Marcus Garvey_ and return.'
  `Armitage, he was wounded?  Blood?'
  `Can't seh, ya know?  But blood, an'~ stone crazy, Case.'
  `Okay,' Case said `So what about me?  You're going home. 
What about me, Maelcum?'
  `Mon,' Maelcum said, `you comin'~ wi'~ me.  I an'~ I come
Zion wi'~ Aerol, _Babylon Rocker._  Leave Mr.~ Armitage t'~ talk
wi'~ ghost cassette, one ghost t'~ 'nother...'
  Case glanced over his shoulder: his rented suit swung against
the hammock where he'd snapped it, swaying in the air current
from the old Russian scrubber.  He closed his eyes.  He saw the
sacs of toxin dissolving in his arteries.  He saw Molly hauling
herself up the endless steel rungs.  He opened his eyes.
  `I dunno, man,' he said, a strange taste in his mouth.  He
looked down at his desk, at his hands.  `I don't know.'  He
looked back up.  The brown face was calm now, intent.  Mael-
cum's chin was hidden by the high helmet ring of his old blue
suit.  `She's inside,' he said.  `Molly's inside.  In Straylight,
it's called.  If there's any Babylon, man, that's it.  We leave on
her, she ain't comin'~ out, Steppin'~ Razor or not.'
  Maelcum nodded, the dreadbag bobbing behind him like a
captive balloon of crocheted cotton.  `She you woman, Case?'
  `I dunno.  Nobody's woman, maybe.'  He shrugged.  And
found his anger again, real as a shard of hot rock beneath his
ribs.  `Fuck this,' he said.  `Fuck Armitage, fuck Wintermute,
and fuck you.  I'm stayin'~ right here.'
  Maelcum's smile spread across his face like light breaking. 
`Maelcum a rude boy, Case.  _Garvey_ Maelcum boat.'  His gloved
hand slapped a panel and the bass-heavy rocksteady of Zion
dub came pulsing from the tug's speakers.  `Maelcum not run-
nin'~, no.  I talk wi'~ Aerol, he certain t'~ see it in similar light.'
  Case stared.  `I don't understand you guys at all,' he said.
  `Don'~ 'stan'~ you, mon,' the Zionite said, nodding to the
beat, `but we mus'~ move by Jah love, each one.'
  Case jacked in and flipped for the matrix.

  `Get my wire?'
  `Yeah.'  He saw that the Chinese program had grown, del-
icate arches of shifting polychrome were nearing the T-A ice.
  `Well, it's gettin'~ stickier,' the Flatline said.  `Your boss
wiped the bank on that other Hosaka, and damn near took ours
with it.  But your pal Wintermute put me on to somethin'~ there
before it went black.  The reason Straylight's not exactly hop-
pin'~ with Tessier-Ashpools is that they're mostly in cold sleep. 
There's a law firm in London keeps track of their powers of
attorney.  Has to know who's awake and exactly when.  Ar-
mitage was routing the transmissions from London to Straylight
through the Hosaka on the yacht.  Incidently, they know the
old man's dead.'
  `Who knows?'
  `The law firm and T-A.  He had a medical remote planted
in his sternum.  Not that your girl's dart would've left a res-
urrection crew with much to work with.  Shellfish toxin.  But
the only T-A awake in Straylight right now is Lady 3Jane
Marie-France.  There's a male, couple years older, in Australia
on business.  You ask me, I bet Wintermute found a way to
cause that business to need this 8Jean's personal attention.  But
he's on his way home, or near as matters.  The London lawyers
give his Straylight ETA as 09:00:00, tonight.  We slotted Kuang
virus at 02:32:03.  It's 04:45:20.  Best estimate for Kuang pen-
etration of the T-A core is 08:30:00.  Or a hair on either side. 
I figure Wintermute's got somethin'~ goin'~ with this 3Jane, or
else she's just as crazy as her old man was.  But the boy up
from Melbourne'll know the score.  The Straylight security sys-
tems keep trying to go full alert, but Wintermute blocks 'em,
don't ask me how.  Couldn't override the basic gate program
to get Molly in, though.  Armitage had a record of all that on
his Hosaka; Riviera must've talked 3Jane into doing it.  She's
been able to fiddle entrances and exits for years.  Looks to me
like one of T-A's main problems is that every family bigwig
has riddled the banks with all kinds of private scams and ex-
ceptions.  Kinda like your immune system falling apart on you. 
Ripe for virus.  Looks good for us, once we're past that ice.'
  `Okay.  But Wintermute said that Arm --'
  A white lozenge snapped into position, filled with a close-
up of mad blue eyes.  Case could only stare.  Colonel Willie
Corto, Special Forces, Strikeforce Screaming Fist, had found
his way back.  The image was dim, jerky, badly focused.  Corto
was using the _Haniwa_'s navigation deck to link with the Hosaka
in _Marcus Garvey._
  `Case, I need the damage reports on Omaha Thunder.'
  `Say.  I...  Colonel?'
  `Hang in there, boy.  Remember your training.'
  _But where have you been, man?_ he silently asked the an-
guished eyes.  Wintermute had built something called Armitage
into a catatonic fortress named Corto.  Had convinced Corto
that Armitage was the real thing, and Armitage had walked,
talked, schemed, bartered data for capital, fronted for Win-
termute in that room in the Chiba Hilton...  And now Arm-
itage was gone, blown away by the winds of Corto's madness. 
But where had Corto _been,_ those years?
  Falling, burned and blinded, out of a Siberian sky.
  `Case, this will be difficult for you to accept, I know that. 
You're an officer.  The training.  I understand.  But, Case, as
God is my witness, we have been betrayed.'
  Tears started from the blue eyes.
  `Colonel, ah, who?  Who's betrayed us?'
  `General Girling, Case.  You may know him by a code name. 
You do know the man of whom I speak.'
  `Yeah,' Case said, as the tears continued to flow, `I guess
I do.  Sir,' he added, on impulse.  `But, sir, Colonel, what
exactly should we do?  Now, I mean.'
  `Our duty at this point, Case, lies in flight.  Escape.  Evasion. 
We can make the Finnish border, nightfall tomorrow.  Treetop
flying on manual.  Seat of the pants, boy.  But that will only
be the beginning.'  The blue eyes slitted above tanned cheek-
bones slick with tears.  `Only the beginning.  Betrayal from
above.  From _above...'_  He stepped back from the camera,
dark stains on his torn twill shirt.  Armitage's face had been
masklike, impassive, but Corto's was the true schizoid mask,
illness etched deep in involuntary muscle, distorting the ex-
pensive surgery.
  `Colonel, I hear you, man.  Listen, Colonel, okay?  I want
you to open the, ah... shit, what's it called, Dix?'
  `The midbay lock,' the Flatline said.
  `Open the midbay lock.  Just tell your central console there
to open it, right?  We'll be up there with you fast, Colonel. 
Then we can talk about getting out of here.'
  The lozenge vanished.
  `Boy, I think you just lost me, there,' the Flatline said.
  `The toxins,' Case said, `the fucking toxins,' and jacked
out.

  `Poison?'  Maelcum watched over the scratched blue shoul-
der of his old Sanyo as Case struggled out of the g-web.
  `And get this goddam thing off me...'  Tugging at the
Texas catheter.  `Like a slow poison, and that asshole upstairs
knows how to counter it, and now he's crazier than a shithouse
rat.'  He fumbled with the front of the red Sanyo, forgetting
how to work the seals.
  `Bossman, he _poison_ you?'  Maelcum scratched his cheek. 
`Got a medical kit, ya know.'
  `Maelcum, Christ, help me with this goddam suit.'
  The Zionite kicked off from the pink pilot module.  `Easy,
mon.  Measure twice, cut once, wise man put it.  We get up
there...'

  There was air in the corrugated gangway that led from _Mar-
cus Garvey_'s aft lock to the midbay lock of the yacht called
_Haniwa,_ but they kept their suits sealed.  Maelcum executed
the passage with balletic grace, only pausing to help Case,
who'd gone into an awkward tumble as he'd stepped out of
_Garvey._  The white plastic sides of the tube filtered the raw
sunlight; there were no shadows.
  _Garvey_'s airlock hatch was patched and pitted, decorated
with a laser-carved Lion of Zion.  _Haniwa_'s midbay hatch was
creamy gray, blank and pristine.  Maelcum inserted his gloved
hand in a narrow recess.  Case saw his fingers move.  Red LEDs
came to life in the recess, counting down from fifty.  Maelcum
withdrew his hand.  Case, with one glove braced against the
hatch, felt the vibration of the lock mechanism through his suit
and bones.  The round segment of gray hull began to withdraw
into the side of _Haniwa._  Maelcum grabbed the recess with one
hand and Case with the other.  The lock took them with it.

  _Haniwa_ was a product of the Dornier-Fujitsu yards, her
interior informed by a design philosophy similar to the one that
had produced the Mercedes that had chauffeured them through
Istanbul.  The narrow midbay was walled in imitation ebony
veneer and floored with gray Italian tiles.  Case felt as though
he were invading some rich man's private spa by way of the
shower.  The yacht, which had been assembled in orbit, had
never been intended for re-entry.  Her smooth, wasplike line
was simply styling, and everything about her interior was cal-
culated to add to the overall impression of speed.
  When Maelcum removed his battered helmet, Case followed
his lead.  They hung there in the lock, breathing air that smelled
faintly of pine.  Under it, a disturbing edge of burning insula-
tion.
  Maelcum sniffed.  `Trouble here, mon.  Any boat, you smell
that...'
  A door, padded with dark gray ultrasuede, slid smoothly
back into its housing.  Maelcum kicked off the ebony wall and
sailed neatly through the narrow opening, twisting his broad
shoulders, at the last possible instant, for clearance.  Case fol-
lowed him clumsily, hand over hand, along a waist-high padded
rail.  `Bridge,' Maelcum said, pointing down a seamless, cream-
walled corridor, `be there.'  He launched himself with another
effortless kick.  From somewhere ahead, Case made out the
familiar chatter of a printer turning out hard copy.  It grew
louder as he followed Maelcum through another doorway, into
a swirling mass of tangled printout.  Case snatched a length of
twisted paper and glanced at it.

  `Systems crash?'  The Zionite flicked a gloved finger at the
column of zeros.
  `No,' Case said, grabbing for his drifting helmet, `the Flat-
line said Armitage wiped the Hosaka he had in there.'
  `Smell like he wipe 'em wi'~ laser, ya know?'  The Zionite
braced his foot against the white cage of a Swiss exercise
machine and shot through the floating maze of paper, batting
it away from his face.
  `Case, mon...'
  The man was small, Japanese, his throat bound to the back
of the narrow articulated chair with a length of some sort of
fine steel wire.  The wire was invisible, where it crossed the
black temperfoam of the headrest, and it had cut as deeply into
his larynx.  A single sphere of dark blood had congealed there
like some strange precious stone, a red-black pearl.  Case saw
the crude wooden handles that drifted at either end of the
garrotte, like worn sections of broom handle.
  `Wonder how long he had that on him?' Case said, re-
membering Corto's postwar pilgrimage.
  `He know how pilot boat, Case, bossman?'
  `Maybe.  He was Special Forces.'
  `Well, this Japan-boy, he not be pilotin'~.  Doubt I pilot her
easy myself.  Ver'~ new boat...'
  `So find us the bridge.'
  Maelcum frowned, rolled backward, and kicked.
  Case followed him into a larger space, a kind of lounge,
shredding and crumpling the lengths of printout that snared him
in his passage.  There were more of the articulated chairs, here,
something that resembled a bar, and the Hosaka.  The printer,
still spewing its flimsy tongue of paper, was an in-built bulk-
head unit, a neat slot in a panel of handrubbed veneer.  He
pulled himself over the circle of chairs and reached it, punching
a white stud to the left of the slot.  The chattering stopped.  He
turned and stared at the Hosaka.  Its face had been drilled through,
at least a dozen times.  The holes were small, circular, edges
blackened.  Tiny spheres of bright alloy were orbiting the dead
computer.  `Good guess,' he said to Maelcum.
  `Bridge locked, mon,' Maelcum said, from the opposite
side of the lounge.
  The lights dimmed, surged, dimmed again.
  Case ripped the printout from its slot.  More zeros.  `Win-
termute?'  He looked around the beige and brown lounge, the
space scrawled with drifting curves of paper.  `That you on the
lights, Wintermute?'
  A panel beside Maelcum's head slid up, revealing a small
monitor.  Maelcum jerked apprehensively, wiped sweat from
his forehead with a foam patch on the back of a gloved hand,
and swung to study the display.  `You read Japanese, mon?' 
Case could see figures blinking past on the screen.
  `No,' Case said.
  `Bridge is escape pod, lifeboat.  Countin'~ down, looks like
it.  Suit up now.'  He ringed his helmet and slapped at the seals.
  `What?  He's takin'~ off?  Shit!'  He kicked off from the
bulkhead and shot through the tangle of printout.  `We gotta
open this door, man!'  But Maelcum could only tap the side of
his helmet.  Case could see his lips moving, through the Lexan. 
He saw a bead of sweat arc out from the rainbow braided band
of the purple cotton net the Zionite wore over his locks.  Mael-
cum snatched the helmet from Case and ringed it for him
smoothly, the palms of his gloves smacking the seals.  Micro- 
LED monitors to the left of the faceplate lit as the neck ring
connections closed.  `No seh Japanese,' Maelcum said, over
his suit's transceiver, `but countdown's wrong.'  He tapped a
particular line on the screen.  `Seals not intact, bridge module. 
Launchin'~ wi'~ lock open.'
  `Armitage!'  Case tried to pound on the door.  The physics
of zero-g sent him tumbling back through the printout.  `Corto! 
Don't do it!  We gotta talk!  We gotta --'
  `Case?  Read you, Case...'  The voice barely resembled
Armitage's now.  It held a weird calm.  Case stopped kicking. 
His helmet struck the far wall.  `I'm sorry, Case, but it has to
be this way.  One of us has to get out.  One of us has to testify. 
If we all go down here, it ends here.  I'll tell them.  Case, I'll
tell them all of it.  About Girling and the others.  And I'll make
it, Case.  I know I'll make it.  To Helsinki.'  There was a sudden
silence; Case felt it fill his helmet like some rare gas.  `But it's
so hard, Case, so goddam hard.  I'm blind.'
  `Corto, stop.  Wait.  You're _blind,_ man.  You can't fly!  You'll
hit the fucking _trees._  And they're trying to get you, Corto.  I
swear to God, they've left your hatch open.  You'll die, and
you'll never get to tell 'em, and I gotta get the enzyme, name
of the enzyme, the enzyme, man...'  He was shouting, voice
high with hysteria.  Feedback shrilled out of the helmet's phone
pads.
  `Remember the training, Case.  That's all we can do.'
  And then the helmet filled with a confused babble, roaring
static, harmonics howling down the years from Screaming Fist. 
Fragments of Russian, and then a stranger's voice, Midwestern,
very young.  `We are down, repeat, Omaha Thunder is down,
we...'
  `Wintermute,' Case screamed, `don't do this to me!'  Tears
broke from his lashes, rebounding off the faceplate in wobbling
crystal droplets.  Then _Haniwa_ thudded, once, shivered as if
some huge soft thing had struck her hull.  Case imagined the
lifeboat jolting free, blown clear by explosive bolts, a second's
clawing hurricane of escaping air tearing mad Colonel Corto
from his couch, from Wintermute's rendition of the final minute
of Screaming Fist.
  `'Im gone, mon.'  Maelcum looked at the monitor.  `Hatch
open.  Mute mus'~ override ejection failsafe.'
  Case tried to wipe the tears of rage from his eyes.  His fingers
clacked against Lexan.
  `Yacht, she tight for air, but bossman takin'~ grapple control
wi'~ bridge.  _Marcus Garvey_ still stuck.'
  But Case was seeing Armitage's endless fall around Free-
side, through vacuum colder than the steppes.  For some reason,
he imagined him in his dark Burberry, the trenchcoat's rich
folds spread out around him like the wings of some huge bat.

  `Get what you went for?' the construct asked.
  Kuang Grade Mark Eleven was filling the grid between itself
and the T-A ice with hypnotically intricate traceries of rainbow,
lattices fine as snow crystal on a winter window.
  `Wintermute killed Armitage.  Blew him out in a lifeboat
with a hatch open.'
  `Tough shit,' the Flatline said.  `Weren't exactly asshole
buddies, were you?'
  `He knew how to unbond the toxin sacs.'
  `So Wintermute knows too.  Count on it.'
  `I don't exactly trust Wintermute to give it to me.'
  The construct's hideous approximation of laughter scraped
Case's nerves like a dull blade.  `Maybe that means you're
gettin'~ smart.'
  He hit the simstim switch.

  06:27:52 by the chip in her optic nerve; Case had been
following her progress through Villa Straylight for over an
hour, letting the endorphin analog she'd taken blot out his
hangover.  The pain in her leg was gone; she seemed to move
through a warm bath.  The Braun drone was perched on her
shoulder, its tiny manipulators, like padded surgical clips, se-
cure in the polycarbon of the Modern suit.
  The walls here were raw steel, striped with rough brown
ribbons of epoxy where some kind of covering had been ripped
away.  She'd hidden from a work crew, crouching, the fletcher
cradled in her hands, her suit steel-gray, while the two slender
Africans and their balloon-tired workcart passed.  The men had
shaven heads and wore orange coveralls.  One was singing softly
to himself in a language Case had never heard, the tones and
melody alien and haunting.
  The head's speech, 3Jane's essay on Straylight, came back
to him as she worked her way deeper into the maze of the
place.  Straylight was crazy, was craziness grown in the resin
concrete they'd mixed from pulverized lunar stone, grown in
welded steel and tons of knick-knacks, all the bizarre impe-
dimentia they'd shipped up the well to line their winding nest. 
But it wasn't a craziness he understood.  Not like Armitage's
madness, which he now imagined he could understand; twist
a man far enough, then twist him as far back, in the opposite
direction, reverse and twist again.  The man broke.  Like break-
ing a length of wire.  And history had done that for Colonel
Corto.  History had already done the really messy work, when
Wintermute found him, sifting him out of all of the war's ripe
detritus, gliding into the man's flat gray field of consciousness
like a water spider crossing the face of some stagnant pool,
the first messages blinking across the face of a child's micro
in a darkened room in a French asylum.  Wintermute had built
Armitage up from scratch, with Corto's memories of Screaming
Fist as the foundation.  But Armitage's `memories' wouldn't
have been Corto's after a certain point.  Case doubted if Ar-
mitage had recalled the betrayal, the Nightwings whirling down
in flame...  Armitage had been a sort of edited version of
Corto, and when the stress of the run had reached a certain
point, the Armitage mechanism had crumbled; Corto had sur-
faced, with his guilt and his sick fury.  And now Corto-Armitage
was dead, a small frozen moon for Freeside.
  He thought of the toxin sacs.  Old Ashpool was dead too,
drilled through the eye with Molly's microscopic dart, deprived
of whatever expert overdose he'd mixed for himself.  That was
a more puzzling death, Ashpool's, the death of a mad king. 
And he'd killed the puppet he'd called his daughter, the one
with 3Jane's face.  It seemed to Case, as he rode Molly's broad-
cast sensory input through the corridors of Straylight, that he'd
never really thought of anyone like Ashpool, anyone as pow-
erful as he imagined Ashpool had been, as human.
  Power, in Case's world, meant corporate power.  The zai-
batsus, the multinationals that shaped the course of human
history, had transcended old barriers.  Viewed as organisms,
they had attained a kind of immortality.  You couldn't kill a
zaibatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives; there were
others waiting to step up the ladder, assume the vacated po-
sition, access the vast banks of corporate memory.  But Tessier- 
Ashpool wasn't like that, and he sensed the difference in the
death of its founder.  T-A was an atavism, a clan.  He remem-
bered the litter of the old man's chamber, the soiled humanity
of it, the ragged spines of the old audio disks in their paper
sleeves.  One foot bare, the other in a velvet slipper.
  The Braun plucked at the hood of the Modern suit and Molly
turned left, through another archway.
  Wintermute and the nest.  Phobic vision of the hatching
wasps, time-lapse machine gun of biology.  But weren't the
zaibatsus more like that, or the Yakuza, hives with cybernetic
memories, vast single organisms, their DNA coded in silicon? 
If Straylight was an expression of the corporate identity of
Tessier-Ashpool, then T-A was crazy as the old man had been. 
The same ragged tangle of fears, the same strange sense of
aimlessness.  `If they'd turned into what they wanted to...'
he remembered Molly saying.  But Wintermute had told her
they hadn't.
  Case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses,
the kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less
than _people._  He'd seen it in the men who'd crippled him in
Memphis, he'd seen Wage affect the semblance of it in Night
City, and it had allowed him to accept Armitage's flatness and
lack of feeling.  He'd always imagined it as a gradual and willing
accommodation of the machine, the system, the parent or-
ganism.  It was the root of street cool, too, the knowing posture
that implied connection, invisible lines up to hidden levels of
influence.
  But what was happening now, in the corridors of Villa
Straylight?
  Whole stretches were being stripped back to steel and con-
crete.
  `Wonder where our Peter is now, huh?  Maybe see that boy
soon,' she muttered.  `And Armitage.  Where's he, Case?'
  `Dead,' he said, knowing she couldn't hear him, `he's
dead.'
  He flipped.

  The Chinese program was face to face with the target ice,
rainbow tints gradually dominated by the green of the rectangle
representing the T-A cores.  Arches of emerald across the col-
orless void.
  `How's it go Dixie?'
  `Fine.  Too slick.  Thing's amazing...  Shoulda had one that
time in Singapore.  Did the old New Bank of Asia for a good
fiftieth of what they were worth.  But that's ancient history. 
This baby takes all the drudgery out of it.  Makes you wonder
what a real war would be like, now...'
  `If this kinda shit was on the street; we'd be out a job,'
Case said.
  `You wish.  Wait'll you're steering that thing upstairs through
black ice.'
  `Sure.'
  Something small and decidedly nongeometric had just ap-
peared on the far end of one of the emerald arches.
  `Dixie...'
  `Yeah.  I see it.  Don't know if I believe it.'
  A brownish dot, a dull gnat against the green wall of the
T-A cores.  It began to advance, across the bridge built by
Kuang Grade Mark Eleven, and Case saw that it was walking. 
As it came, the green section of the arch extended, the poly-
chrome of the virus program rolling back, a few steps ahead
of the cracked black shoes.
  `Gotta hand it to you, boss,' the Flatline said, when the
short, rumpled figure of the Finn seemed to stand
